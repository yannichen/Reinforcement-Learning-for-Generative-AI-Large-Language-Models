Our actions were proactive and disciplined – \\\\r\\\\nsimplifying and modernizing work; integrating teams, processes and value chains across business units and geographies; elevating \\\\r\\\\nleadership capabilities; advancing digital solutions; and empowering our workforce to make decisions quickly, safely and with \\\\r\\\\ngreater accountability. \\\\r\\\\nWe leveraged our strengths to design a better company for the long term – one that can act deliberately, seize opportunity and \\\\r\\\\ngenerate stronger returns. And we remained true to our values, prepared to succeed in any environment, and adaptive in a dynamic \\\\r\\\\nworld where disruption is routine. \\\\r\\\\nOur fnancial priorities have not changed: \\\\r\\\\ngrowing \\\\r\\\\nthe dividend \\\\r\\\\nWhile others are lowering dividends, we have maintained ours \\\\r\\\\nas we know it is a vital source of stockholder income. In 2020, we \\\\r\\\\nincreased our payout 8 percent, the 33rd consecutive annual \\\\r\\\\nincrease in per-share dividend payout. \\\\r\\\\nmaintaining a strong \\\\r\\\\nbalance sheet \\\\r\\\\nFinancial strength – demonstrated by our industry-leading \\\\r\\\\nnet debt ratio – gives us the fexibility to navigate uncertain \\\\r\\\\nmarket conditions and address emerging opportunities. \\\\r\\\\nreinvesting to \\\\r\\\\ngrow\\\\xa0future\\\\xa0cash fows \\\\r\\\\nImproving capital efciency allows us to sustain our future \\\\r\\\\nat a lower reinvestment rate. The Noble Energy acquisition is \\\\r\\\\nexpected to generate free cash fow and added $13 billion in \\\\r\\\\nenterprise value. \\\\r\\\\nreturning excess \\\\r\\\\ncash to stockholders \\\\r\\\\nAfter meeting the frst three priorities, we return excess cash \\\\r\\\\nto stockholders through buybacks. We have repurchased \\\\r\\\\nshares in 13 of the last 17 years, including returning $1.75 billion \\\\r\\\\nto stockholders in 2020. \\\\r\\\\nOur priorities anchor our commitment to deliver higher returns. They guide us in good times – and we stand by them in difcult \\\\r\\\\ntimes. They dictate a disciplined approach to capital allocation. They inform actions to strengthen our already advantaged \\\\r\\\\nportfolio through smart acquisitions and prudent divestments – focusing on assets that deliver higher returns. Our success in \\\\r\\\\nreliably delivering value for stockholders will be commemorated this year when we celebrate a full century on the New York Stock \\\\r\\\\nExchange – one of only 29 companies to reach this milestone. \\\\r\\\\noperating with resilience \\\\r\\\\nDuring 2020, global oil demand fell by some 9 percent, while \\\\r\\\\nnatural gas demand fell by a more modest 3 percent. Stress \\\\r\\\\nin energy markets was compounded by intense competition \\\\r\\\\nfor market share among the world’s key oil producers. These \\\\r\\\\ndisruptions occurred against the backdrop of geopolitical \\\\r\\\\nuncertainty and growing economic distress. \\\\r\\\\nWe demonstrated both resilience and agility in adjusting to \\\\r\\\\nextreme market conditions, balancing short-term cash fow \\\\r\\\\nand long-term value. Our portfolio is anchored in businesses \\\\r\\\\nthat are low cost, large scale and long-lived – from our royalty\\\\ufffeadvantaged position in the Permian and growing natural \\\\r\\\\ngas business in the Eastern Mediterranean to our feedstock\\\\ufffeadvantaged chemicals business and leading fuels brands on \\\\r\\\\nthe U.S. West Coast. We expect to deliver results through the \\\\r\\\\nbusiness cycle, creating greater value for our stockholders and \\\\r\\\\nstronger cash fow for decades. \\\\r\\\\nWhen market conditions deteriorated in 2020, we swiftly \\\\r\\\\nreduced capital spending by 35 percent from 2019. We also \\\\r\\\\nreduced operating costs, refecting our commitment to \\\\r\\\\nboth capital and cost discipline. In the Permian Basin, we \\\\r\\\\ndemonstrated our fexibility to cut short-cycle capital. At the \\\\r\\\\nsame time, we redoubled internal transformation eforts to \\\\r\\\\nbecome more agile, cost efcient and streamlined. \\\\r\\\\nIn our Upstream business, the acquisition of Noble Energy \\\\r\\\\nadded complementary high-quality assets in Texas’s \\\\r\\\\nPermian Basin, Colorado’s DJ Basin and the Eastern \\\\r\\\\nMediterranean. Portfolio additions in 2020 included \\\\r\\\\napproximately 5.67\\\\xa0million net exploration acres. We added \\\\r\\\\n832 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves \\\\r\\\\nin 2020, with the largest net additions coming from the \\\\r\\\\nNoble\\\\xa0Energy\\\\xa0acquisition. \\\\r\\\\nDespite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, \\\\r\\\\nwe advanced construction of the Future Growth Project\\\\ufffeWellhead Pressure Management Project at Tengizchevroil \\\\r\\\\nin Kazakhstan. Over three years, we safely delivered by sea \\\\r\\\\n408\\\\xa0modules, many of which weighed between 500 and \\\\r\\\\n1,800 tons, to the Tengiz Field from fabrication sites in Italy, \\\\r\\\\nKazakhstan and South Korea. \\\\r\\\\nChevron Corporation 2020 Annual Report \\\\r\\\\nIII\\\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/Chevron/Chevron_2020.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='1149230_Annual_Report_v8.3_r1.indd 4 3/12/21 10:37 AM\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xa0 \\\\xa0\\\\r\\\\nIn our Downstream business, we completed the acquisition \\\\r\\\\nof Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty Ltd., adding a \\\\r\\\\nnetwork of more than 360 company- and retailer-owned \\\\r\\\\nservice stations, a commercial and industrial fuels business, \\\\r\\\\nowned and leased seaboard import terminals and fuel \\\\r\\\\ndistribution depots. And we made excellent progress on \\\\r\\\\nGS Caltex’s olefns mixed-feed cracker project at the Yeosu \\\\r\\\\nRefnery in South Korea. \\\\r\\\\nIn 2020, we also increased production of renewable products \\\\r\\\\nand investments in low-carbon technologies, consistent \\\\r\\\\nwith our energy transition strategy to help advance a lower\\\\ufffecarbon future. During the year, Chevron announced frst gas \\\\r\\\\nproduction at our CalBioGas renewable natural gas (RNG) \\\\r\\\\njoint venture in California, formed a new RNG partnership with \\\\r\\\\nBrightmark and announced frst production of renewable base \\\\r\\\\noil through a joint venture with Novvi. \\\\r\\\\nDuring a year of unprecedented challenges, we also delivered \\\\r\\\\none of our safest years ever. This refects our commitment to \\\\r\\\\nprotecting people and the environment – and our unwavering \\\\r\\\\ndetermination to keep getting better. \\\\r\\\\nadvancing a lower-carbon future \\\\r\\\\nHelping advance a lower-carbon future requires actions that \\\\r\\\\ndrive measurable progress, demonstrating the improvements \\\\r\\\\nwe are making today and our intention to do more tomorrow. \\\\r\\\\nOur energy transition strategy focuses on three action areas: \\\\r\\\\ny We are reducing the carbon intensity of our operations \\\\r\\\\nand assets, prioritizing the projects that return the largest \\\\r\\\\nreduction in carbon emissions at the lowest cost to \\\\r\\\\ncustomers and society. \\\\r\\\\ny We are increasing renewables and ofsets in support of \\\\r\\\\nour business. \\\\r\\\\ny And we are investing in low-carbon technologies to enable \\\\r\\\\ncommercial solutions while leveraging our capabilities \\\\r\\\\nand operations to advance technologies such as carbon \\\\r\\\\ncapture and hydrogen. \\\\r\\\\nThese actions will help make energy and global supply chains \\\\r\\\\nmore sustainable – so industries and customers who use our \\\\r\\\\nproducts can work toward building a lower-carbon world. \\\\r\\\\nlooking ahead \\\\r\\\\nWe are coming out of a year like none other: a global pandemic; \\\\r\\\\na historic lockdown of economic activity; and unprecedented \\\\r\\\\ndisruption in energy markets. \\\\r\\\\nYet the greatest challenges can call forth the greatest responses. \\\\r\\\\nThrough the power of innovation, markets and partnership, \\\\r\\\\nscientists developed multiple COVID-19 vaccines in record time. \\\\r\\\\nThe tide is beginning to turn, and the pandemic will eventually \\\\r\\\\nrecede. This inspiring example points the way to meeting other \\\\r\\\\ngreat challenges – eliminating poverty, creating prosperity for \\\\r\\\\nall and delivering the sustainable environment everyone desires. \\\\r\\\\nOn this foundation of hope, optimism and confdence, we can \\\\r\\\\nwork together to achieve an even brighter future. \\\\r\\\\nAt Chevron, our people are helping to build this future, \\\\r\\\\nproviding the afordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy that \\\\r\\\\nbillions of people rely on every day. We take great pride in \\\\r\\\\nenabling human progress around the world. And we are deeply \\\\r\\\\ngrateful to all our employees, partners and stockholders who \\\\r\\\\nmake this work possible. \\\\r\\\\nThank you for your support and the trust you place in us. \\\\r\\\\nSincerely, \\\\r\\\\nMichael K.
