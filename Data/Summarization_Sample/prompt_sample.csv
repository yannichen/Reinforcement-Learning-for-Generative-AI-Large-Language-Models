We \r\nalso made progressive moves in mobility, such as the acquisition \r\nof the UK’s leading electric vehicle charging network to create \r\nBP Chargemaster.\r\nBP is in good shape. Our strategy is delivering value for you, \r\nour shareholders, while being flexible and agile for the energy \r\ntransition underway.\r\n• We continued to focus on advantaged oil and gas in the Upstream, \r\ndelivering new supplies of gas from four of our six new major projects \r\nbrought online in 2018. We are also expanding our LNG portfolio and \r\ndeveloping new markets in transport and power.\r\n• In the Downstream, we expanded our retail offer, as seen by more \r\nthan 25% growth in our convenience partnerships, to around 1,400 \r\nsites worldwide.\r\n• As we pursue venturing and low carbon across multiple fronts, \r\nLightsource BP doubled its global solar presence to 10 countries.\r\n• And we underpinned all this by continuing to modernize our plants, \r\nprocesses, and portfolio by harnessing the potential of digital and new \r\ntechnologies to provide greater efficiencies, reliability and safety. \r\nAdvancing the energy transition\r\nThe deals we made and the strategy we have in place are evidence that \r\nBP is a forward-looking energy business. One that is already playing an \r\nactive role in advancing the energy transition.\r\nThat’s why we are making bold changes across our entire business to \r\nreduce emissions in our operations, improve products to help customers \r\nreduce their own emissions, and to create new low carbon businesses. \r\nThis is our ‘reduce, improve, create’ (RIC) framework which we are \r\nbacking up with clear targets. I am pleased to report we are making \r\ngood progress against these targets.\r\nBP is also working with peers on a range of fronts, in particular to tackle \r\nmethane emissions and create opportunities for carbon capture, \r\nutilization and storage. You’ll see this in our work with the Oil and Gas \r\nClimate Initiative, which I chair, and whose members now represent \r\n30% of global oil and gas production. \r\nAs well as action across the industry, at BP we understand that meeting \r\nour own low carbon ambitions is a shared responsibility across our \r\nentire business. That’s why we are now incentivizing around 36,000 \r\nemployees who are eligible for an annual cash bonus to play a role by \r\nlinking their reward to one of our emissions reduction targets. \r\nPossibilities everywhere\r\nWe will continue to be open and transparent about our ambitions, plans \r\nand progress, recognizing that the trust of our shareholders and other \r\nstakeholders is essential to BP remaining a reliable and attractive \r\nlong-term investment. And only by ensuring we remain a world-class \r\ninvestment, can we most effectively play our part in advancing a low \r\ncarbon future.\r\nAs a global energy business with scale, expertise and strong \r\nrelationships around the world, we don’t just believe we have an \r\nimportant part to play in the dual challenge, we see value-generating \r\nopportunities for BP throughout the energy transition.\r\nWe’re making good progress delivering our strategy while flexing and \r\nadapting to an environment that is changing fast. We have a great team \r\nat BP and I would like to thank them all for their continued dedication and \r\nrelentless commitment to advancing the energy transition. \r\nBob Dudley\r\nGroup chief executive\r\n29 March 2019\r\nGAAP equivalents\r\nProfit attributable to shareholders: $9.4bn (2017: $3.4bn)\r\nAverage capital employed: $165.5bn (2017: $159.4bn)\r\nOur strategy is delivering value for you, \r\nour shareholders, while being flexible \r\nand agile for the energy transition \r\nunderway. \r\n8 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/BP PLC/BP PLC_2018.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='Strategic report – overview\r\nThe demand for energy is set to increase significantly – growing \r\neconomies need energy to support their industry and infrastructure. \r\nIn all the scenarios considered, world GDP more than doubles by 2040 \r\ndriven by increasing prosperity in fast-growing developing economies. \r\nIn the evolving transition scenario, this improvement in living standards \r\ncauses energy demand to increase by a third by 2040, driven mainly by \r\nIndia, China and other developing Asian economies. The rate of growth \r\nhowever is slower than in the previous 20 years, as the world increasingly \r\nlearns to produce more with less energy. Despite this, a substantial \r\nproportion of the world’s population in 2040 could live in countries where \r\nthe average energy consumption per person is relatively low. \r\nAt the same time, the energy mix is changing as technology advances, \r\nconsumer preferences shift and policy measures evolve. Renewables \r\nare now the fastest-growing energy source in the world today and in our \r\nevolving transition scenario we estimate that they could account for \r\n15% of all energy consumption in 2040 – and in other scenarios more. \r\nThat said, oil and gas could meet at least 50% of the world’s energy \r\nneeds in 2040 – even in a scenario consistent with the Paris goals, with \r\nthe share of gas growing aided by increasing use of carbon capture, use \r\nand storage.\r\nGas offers a cleaner alternative to coal for power generation and can \r\nlower emissions at scale. It also provides a valuable partner for \r\nrenewables intermittency, delivers heating at the high temperatures \r\nrequired by industry and is increasingly used in transportation. Across \r\nour scenarios, gas grows robustly, overtaking coal as the second-largest \r\nsource of energy by 2030.\r\nOil demand grows for the next 10 years in our evolving transition scenario, \r\nbefore gradually levelling out due to factors such as accelerating gains in \r\nvehicle efficiency and greater use of biofuels, natural gas and electricity. \r\nThe largest source of oil demand growth is the non-combusted use of oil, \r\nfor example as a feedstock for petrochemicals.\r\nThe BP Energy Outlook explores the forces shaping the \r\nglobal energy transition out to 2040 and the key uncertainties \r\nsurrounding that transition.

The \r\nenvironment in which we operate is dynamic. The biggest \r\nquestions of the future remain unanswered. Our work is \r\ncomplex and demanding. Yet for 140 years, the ingenuity \r\nof our people has led to new insights, new discoveries and \r\nnew innovations. \r\nThis is not a coincidence. Our culture is \r\ndefined by our values, which emphasize a \r\ndeep commitment to diversity and inclusion, \r\nhigh performance, innovation, integrity, \r\nand trust. This has been part of our \r\nDNA for decades. \r\nTo hold ourselves to this high standard — and to ensure an \r\neffective approach to human capital management — we \r\nregularly seek employee feedback to understand where \r\nChevron is performing well and where we can further improve. \r\nOur Board of Directors takes this input seriously — and we \r\nact on it. Based on feedback, we are working to Build Our \r\nTomorrow, by putting new digital technologies in the hands \r\nof employees, promoting better, faster decision making and \r\nrevamping our performance management system. \r\nWe use social media and other platforms to create access to \r\ninformation, remove organizational barriers, and bridge vast \r\ngeographic expanses to exchange ideas and communicate. \r\nThese are just some of the ways we put The Chevron Way to \r\nwork, ensuring a culture in which all voices are heard, all ideas \r\nare considered and all our people have the opportunity to \r\ncontribute to their fullest.\r\nActions like these are essential in today’s environment. \r\nBut we recognize that leadership goes well beyond \r\ndelivering strong financial returns and creating a compelling \r\nwork experience. We must also deliver value for society.\r\ndeclining in the last quarter. LNG markets continued to respond \r\nto strength in Asian gas demand. The return of U.S. sanctions \r\non Iran, volatility in the Middle East, trade tensions between \r\nChina and the United States, Russia sanctions, and worsening \r\nconditions in Venezuela created further uncertainty for global \r\nenergy markets.\r\nAlthough market conditions may remain volatile, our portfolio \r\nis resilient. We are focused on creating value through a \r\ndisciplined capital program that prioritizes efficient, low-risk, \r\nshort-cycle investments. Our Upstream portfolio is anchored \r\nby large, long-lived assets with low production decline. An \r\nefficient, high-return Downstream business complements \r\nour Upstream. Across all our business segments, we are \r\naccelerating the deployment of digital technologies to improve \r\nrevenues, reduce costs, increase reliability and improve safety. \r\nWe are making smart investments and building our company to \r\nwin in any environment.\r\nIn 2018, we also had our best year ever in health, environment \r\nand safety performance, with no fatalities of employees or \r\ncontractors in any of our operations. We continue to lead the \r\nindustry in personal safety performance and meet or exceed \r\ntargets on all core personal safety metrics. This performance is \r\ndirectly related to our strong Operational Excellence culture and \r\nan increased focus on safeguard assurance for high-risk work.\r\nOur success is inextricably linked to the social progress and economic prosperity of the communities where we work. \r\nOur operations deliver good jobs and a better life.

In our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, available \r\nat www.chevron.com/cr, we highlight our performance in several environmental, social and governance areas. \r\nOver the last five years, Chevron invested $154 billion in global goods \r\nand services and more than $1 billion in global social programs.\r\nWe are in the business of progress, and we cannot do this work alone. Across the countries where we operate, we \r\nrely on thousands of partners who help us convert our aspirations into real results. One such example is our support \r\nof the Global Fund and its work in Africa and the Pacific Rim fighting HIV/AIDS. In 2018, the Global Fund directed \r\n$2.5 million from Chevron to providing antiretroviral therapy to almost 20,000 people and helping reduce the \r\nmother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. Since 2008, we have provided more than $60 million to the Global Fund, \r\ncontributing to its success in saving more than 27 million lives.\r\nrecord safety\r\n2018 marks our best year on record in \r\nhealth, environment and safety\r\nChevron Corporation 2018 Annual Report\r\nIV\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/Chevron/Chevron_2018.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='We provide the affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy \r\nneeded to meet rising demand.

Summarize the company's performances and future plans according to the CEO's letter: /n {text} /n SUMMARY:,"[Document(page_content='SHELL ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 20-F 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT 09\r\nShell delivered a very strong financial performance in 2018. We are \r\ncontinuing to make good progress in building a world-class investment case. \r\nHigher oil and gas prices, combined with our ongoing work to improve the \r\nperformance and competitiveness of our businesses, contributed to a sharp \r\nincrease in cash flow from operating activities to $53 billion in 2018. We \r\nare on track with our outlook of annual free cash flow of between $30 \r\nbillion and $35 billion by 2020, at a Brent crude oil price of $60 a barrel \r\n(real terms 2016). \r\nWe delivered on our promises for the year, including completing our $30-\r\nbillion divestment programme and starting up key growth projects, while \r\nmaintaining discipline on capital investment. We paid our entire dividend in \r\ncash, further reduced our debt and launched our share buyback \r\nprogramme. \r\nBut 2018 was not all good news for us. Tragically, a contractor died at our \r\nRheinland refinery in Germany and another died at an onshore well in the \r\nUSA. I am deeply unhappy about these incidents and call on all Shell \r\nemployees, contractors and suppliers to redouble their focus on safety. \r\nRESULTS \r\nIncome for the period was $23.9 billion in 2018, compared with $13.4 \r\nbillion in 2017. Earnings on a current cost of supplies basis increased to \r\n$24.4 billion, compared with $12.5 billion in 2017. We distributed $15.7 \r\nbillion to shareholders in dividends in 2018. \r\nAfter cancelling the Scrip Dividend Programme with effect from the fourth \r\nquarter 2017 dividend, our healthy free cash flow outlook and stronger \r\nbalance sheet gave us the confidence to start our share buyback \r\nprogramme in mid-2018. We intend to buy back at least $25 billion of \r\nshares by the end of 2020, subject to further progress with debt reduction \r\nand oil price conditions. \r\nWith the continued strengthening of our balance sheet, cash flows and our \r\nongoing focus on capital efficiency, I am confident that we will do this while \r\ncontinuing to grow our portfolio. \r\nWe continued to deliver new projects, including the completion of an \r\nimportant chemical plant expansion in China and starting production from a \r\ndeep-water development in the US Gulf of Mexico a year ahead of \r\nschedule. Overall, our production averaged 3.7 million barrels of oil \r\nequivalent a day in 2018, unchanged from 2017. Increased production from \r\nnew field start-ups and ramp-ups, as well as lower maintenance activity, was \r\noffset by the impact of divestments and field declines. \r\nStronger crude oil and gas prices contributed to sharp increases in our \r\nUpstream and Integrated Gas earnings, while Downstream earnings fell \r\nslightly. \r\nWe continued to streamline our business – including the sale of our \r\nDownstream business in Argentina; Upstream interests in Iraq, Ireland, \r\nNorway and Oman; and Integrated Gas interests in Malaysia, New \r\nZealand and Thailand. \r\nThe progress of our divestments has helped us to reduce net debt, with \r\ngearing standing at 20.3% at the end of 2018, down from 25.0% in 2017. \r\nAlthough our $30 billion divestment programme for 2016-18 has been \r\nsuccessfully completed, we expect to continue divestments at an average \r\nrate of more than $5 billion a year until at least 2020. This will help us to \r\nfurther strengthen the balance sheet, reduce debt and increase focus on our \r\nstrategic priorities. \r\nCapital investment in 2018 was slightly below $25 billion, reflecting our \r\ndisciplined capital investment approach. Our capital investment outlook \r\nremains between $25 billion and $30 billion a year until 2020. We see \r\n$30 billion as a ceiling, even in a high oil price environment. Our continued \r\nfocus on capital efficiency and streamlining our portfolio will make us more \r\nresilient and competitive. \r\nWe will continue to carefully control our costs and investment levels, but we \r\nare still investing in strong commercial opportunities for growth. For \r\nexample, we added deep-water exploration acreage in both the Mexican \r\nand US parts of the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Brazil, and off the \r\ncoast of Mauritania in 2018. We also announced two large deep-water \r\ndiscoveries in the US Gulf of Mexico. \r\nNatural gas will play a key role in the transition to a lower-carbon global \r\nenergy system over the next few decades, with liquefied natural gas (LNG) \r\nshipments playing an increasingly important part. This is one of the driving \r\nforces behind our taking the final investment decision in 2018 on LNG \r\nCanada, a major project in which Shell has a 40% interest. \r\nLNG Canada is well positioned to help Shell meet some of the world’s \r\ngrowing gas needs. We expect the cash flow it generates to be significant \r\nand resilient. Sustainable development was considered in every aspect of \r\nthe project. For example, it has been designed to achieve the lowest \r\ncarbon intensity of any LNG project in operation today, aided by the \r\npartial use of hydropower. \r\nIn December, Shell announced plans to set short-term targets for reducing the \r\nNet Carbon Footprint of the energy products it sells – a carbon intensity \r\nmeasure that includes our customers’ emissions when they use these products \r\n– and to link these targets to executive remuneration. This is an industry first. \r\nShell’s Remuneration Committee will include a new performance condition \r\nlinked to the transition to lower-carbon energy for the Long-term Incentive \r\nPlan grant starting in 2019, one year earlier than planned. Further details \r\nare in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. \r\nIn 2018, I also announced our ambition to provide a reliable electricity \r\nsupply to 100 million people in the developing world by 2030. Economic \r\nand social progress are being hindered in many countries by a lack of \r\nreliable energy supplies that are essential to providing basic medical \r\nservices and clean water, for example. Better access to energy improves \r\npeople’s lives. \r\nI am proud of Shell’s success in 2018. We will continue to focus on \r\ndelivering on our strategy in 2019, maintaining our disciplined approach to \r\ncapital investment while working to grow our cash flow and returns. Our \r\nstrategy to deliver a world-class investment case is working. \r\nBen van Beurden \r\nChief Executive Officer \r\nChief Executive Offi cer’s review:\r\nDelivering on our promises\r\nShell Annual Report_Master Template.indd 9 18/03/2019 17:16:57\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/Shell plc/Shell plc_2018.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='10 STRATEGIC REPORT SHELL ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 20-F 2018\r\nSTRATEGY \r\nShell’s purpose is to power progress together by providing more and \r\ncleaner energy solutions. Our strategy is to strengthen our position as a \r\nleading energy company by providing oil, gas and low-carbon energy as \r\nthe world’s energy system transforms. Safety and social responsibility are \r\nfundamental to our business approach. Shell will only succeed by working \r\ncollaboratively with customers, governments, business partners, investors \r\nand other stakeholders. \r\nOur strategy is founded on our outlook for the energy sector and the chance \r\nto grasp the opportunities arising from the substantial changes in the world \r\naround us. The rising standard of living of a growing global population is likely \r\nto continue to drive demand for energy, including oil and gas, for years to \r\ncome. At the same time, technology changes and the need to tackle climate \r\nchange means there is a transition under way to a lower-carbon, multi-source \r\nenergy system with increasing customer choice. We recognise that the pace \r\nand path forward are uncertain and require agile decision-making. \r\nSTRATEGIC AMBITIONS \r\nAgainst this backdrop, we have the following strategic ambitions to guide \r\nus in pursuing our purpose: \r\n\x83 to provide a world-class investment case. This involves growing free cash\r\nflow and increasing returns, all built upon a strong financial framework\r\nand resilient portfolio;\r\n\x83 to thrive in the energy transition by responding to society’s desire for\r\nmore and cleaner, convenient and competitive energy; and\r\n\x83 to sustain a strong societal licence to operate and make a positive\r\ncontribution to society through our activities.\r\nThe execution of our strategy is founded on becoming a more customer\ufffecentric and simpler, more streamlined organisation, focused on growing \r\nreturns and free cash flow. By investing in competitive projects, driving down \r\ncosts and selling non-core businesses, we are continuously reshaping our \r\nportfolio to become a more resilient and focused company. \r\nOur ability to achieve our strategic ambitions depends on how we respond \r\nto competitive forces. We continuously assess the external environment – \r\nthe markets as well as the underlying economic, political, social and \r\nenvironmental drivers that shape them – to evaluate changes in competitive \r\nforces and business models. We use multiple future scenarios to assess the \r\nresilience of our strategy. We undertake regular reviews of the markets we \r\noperate in and analyse trends and uncertainties, as well as our traditional \r\nand non-traditional competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, to understand \r\nour competitive position. We maintain business strategies and plans that \r\nfocus on actions and capabilities to create and sustain competitive \r\nadvantage. We maintain a risk management framework that regularly \r\nassesses our response to, and risk appetite for, identified risk factors (see \r\n“Risk factors” on page 15). \r\nOur Executive Directors’ remuneration is linked to the successful delivery of \r\nour strategy, based on performance indicators that are aligned with \r\nshareholder interests. Long-term incentives form the majority of the Executive \r\nDirectors’ remuneration for above-target performance. In 2018, the Long\ufffeterm Incentive Plan (LTIP) included cash generation, capital discipline, and \r\nvalue created for shareholders metrics. See the “Directors’ Remuneration \r\nReport” on page 142. \r\nSTRATEGIC THEMES \r\nAs part of our strategy, we divide our portfolio into strategic themes, each \r\nwith distinctive capabilities, growth strategies, risk management, capital \r\nallocation and expected returns: \r\n\x83 Cash engines are strategic themes that are expected to provide strong and \r\nresilient returns and free cash flow, funding shareholder returns and \r\nstrengthening the balance sheet. Shell continues to invest in selective growth \r\nopportunities for cash engines. Our cash engines are Conventional Oil and \r\nGas in Upstream, Integrated Gas, and Oil Products in Downstream. \r\n\x83 Growth priorities are the cash engines of the future. Shell seeks to invest\r\nin affordable growth in advantaged positions with a pathway to free\r\ncash flow and returns in the near future. Our growth priorities currently\r\nare Deep water in Upstream and Chemicals in Downstream.\r\n\x83 Emerging opportunities are strategic themes that are expected to\r\nbecome growth priorities after further development. These businesses\r\nshould provide us with material growth in free cash flow in the next\r\ndecade or beyond. We seek to manage our exposure to these\r\nbusinesses while establishing scale. Our emerging opportunities currently\r\nare Shales in Upstream and New Energies, which is part of the\r\nIntegrated Gas organisation.\r\nFor more details on how the strategic themes are embedded into our \r\nbusinesses, see “Business Overview” on page 13. \r\nOur intention is to have an advantaged and resilient position in each \r\nstrategic theme to drive an optimal free cash flow and returns profile over \r\nmultiple timelines. When we set our plans and goals, we do so on the basis \r\nof delivering sustained returns over decades. \r\nOUTLOOK FOR 2019 AND BEYOND \r\nWe continuously seek to improve our operating performance and maximise \r\nsustainable free cash flow, with an emphasis on health, safety, security, \r\nenvironment and asset performance, as well as our ethics and compliance \r\nprinciples. In order to achieve that, we strive for highly qualified and \r\nmotivated employees. \r\nWe are on track with our outlook of annual free cash flow of between $30 \r\nbillion and $35 billion by 2020, at a Brent crude oil price of $60 a barrel \r\n(real terms 2016). \r\nOur capital investment outlook remains between $25 billion and $30 billion \r\na year until 2020. We see $30 billion as a ceiling, even in a high oil price \r\nenvironment. \r\nFollowing the successful delivery of our $30 billion divestment programme \r\nduring 2016-18, we will continue with an annual average outlook of at least \r\n$5 billion of divestments in 2019 and 2020. \r\nFollowing the delivery of an additional $10 billion of cash flow from \r\noperations between 2014 and 2018, key project start-ups and ramp-ups are \r\nexpected to generate an additional $5 billion cash flow from operations \r\nbetween 2018 and 2020, assuming $60 per barrel (real terms 2016) and \r\nmid-cycle Downstream industry conditions. We will remain highly selective \r\non new investment decisions throughout 2019 and beyond. \r\nStrategy and outlook\r\nShell Annual Report_Master Template.indd 10 18/03/2019 17:16:57\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/Shell plc/Shell plc_2018.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='SHELL ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 20-F 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT 11\r\nWe launched our share buyback programme in 2018. Our intention remains \r\nto buy back at least $25 billion of our shares by the end of 2020, subject \r\nto further progress with debt reduction and oil price conditions. \r\nWe fully support the Paris Agreement’s goal to keep the rise in global \r\naverage temperature this century to well below two degrees Celsius above \r\npre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase even \r\nfurther to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We have set a long-term ambition to reduce the \r\nNet Carbon Footprint of our energy products, measured in grams of carbon\ufffedioxide equivalent per megajoule consumed, by around 20% by 2035 and \r\nby around 50% by 2050, in pace with society. To operationalise this long\ufffeterm ambition, we will start setting specific Net Carbon Footprint targets for \r\nshorter-term periods. The first target has been set for a three-year period and is \r\ndetailed in the Climate Change section on page 77. The target and other \r\nmeasures will be linked to our executive remuneration and we have \r\nintroduced an additional performance condition in our Long-term Incentive \r\nPlan (LTIP) in 2019 linked to the transition to lower-carbon energy. Further \r\ndetails can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 124. \r\nThe statements in this “Strategy and outlook” section, including those related \r\nto our growth strategies and our expected or potential future cash flow from \r\noperations, free cash flow, share buybacks, capital investment, divestments, \r\nproduction and Net Carbon Footprint are based on management’s current \r\nexpectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, involve \r\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or \r\nevents to differ materially from those expressed or implied herein.

It approves investment and \r\ndivestment operations when they concern amounts that exceed 3% \r\nof the Group’s equity and examines all matters related to the proper \r\nrunning of the Company. It monitors the management of both financial \r\nand non- financial matters and ensures the quality of information \r\nprovided to shareholders and to financial markets. \r\nThe Board of Directors relies on the work of four Committees that it \r\nhas constituted: the Audit Committee, the Governance and Ethics \r\nCommittee, the Compensation Committee and the Strategy & CSR \r\nCommittee. \r\nComposed as of March 13, 2019, of 12 directors, including \r\n9 independent members, the Board of Directors reflects diversity \r\nand complementarity of experience, expertise, nationalities and \r\ncultures necessary to take account of the interests of all the Group’s \r\nshareholders and stakeholders. \r\nSince December 2015, Mr. Patrick Pouyanné has held the position \r\nof Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TOTAL S.A. His term of \r\noffice having been renewed at the General Shareholders’ Meeting on \r\nJune 1, 2018 for a three- year period, the Board of Directors has \r\nreappointed Mr. Pouyanné as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer \r\nfor an equal period to that of his mandate as a director. The decision \r\nto uphold the combined functions of Chairman of the Board of \r\nDirectors and Chief Executive Officer was made following work \r\nundertaken by the Governance and Ethics Committee, in the interest \r\nof the Company and in compliance with the traditions of the Group. \r\nThe Board of Directors deemed that the unified Management Form \r\nwas most appropriate to the Group’s organization, modus operandi \r\nand business, and to the specificities of the oil and gas sector. In its \r\ndecision, the Board in particular noted the advantage of having unified \r\nmanagement in strategic negotiations with States and the Group’s \r\npartners. The Board of Directors regularly examines whether maintaining \r\nthe unified Management Form remains appropriate. \r\nAttentive to the concerns of investors and stakeholders, the Board of \r\nDirectors pays specific attention to the balance of power within the \r\nGroup. Consequently, every year, the Board examines desirable \r\nchanges to its composition to ensure it is maintaining a high level of \r\nindependence and the full involvement of the directors in the work of \r\nthe Board and of the Committees. It was also for these reasons that \r\nthe Board of Directors, at its meeting on December 16, 2015, \r\namended the provisions of its Rules of Procedure to provide for the \r\nappointment of a Lead Independent Director in case of the combination \r\nof the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief \r\nExecutive Officer. The Lead Independent Director’s duties, resources \r\nand rights are described in the Rules of Procedure of the Board of \r\nDirectors. Aside from these duties, the Chairman and Chief Executive \r\nOfficer and the Lead Independent Director strive to maintain permanent \r\ncontact on any important matter concerning the running of the \r\nCompany. \r\nSince 2016, the Lead Independent Director has organized executive \r\nsessions with the independent directors so that they may discuss \r\nthe Group’s strategic challenges and working practices. The directors \r\nare also in regular contact with the members of the Group’s \r\nmanagement team, whether members of the Executive Committee \r\nduring Board Meetings or operational managers during Group site \r\nvisits. These interactions between directors and managers enable the \r\ndirectors to gain a practical understanding of the Group’s activities. \r\nThe balance of power within the Company’s bodies is thereby \r\nensured by a stable and structured governance. \r\nRegistration Document 2018 TOTAL \n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/TotalEnergies/TotalEnergies_2018.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='1 PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP – INTEGRATED REPORT \r\nPresentation of the Group and its governance \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n6 \r\nOverview of the Board of Directors \r\nAppendix 3 of the AFEP- MEDEF Code\r\n Personal information Experience Position on the Board\r\nParticipation \r\n in Board \r\n Committees\r\n Age Gender Nationality\r\n Number\r\n of shares\r\n Number of\r\n directorships \r\n held at listed \r\ncorporations (a)\r\nIndepen\ufffedence \r\n Initial \r\n date of\r\n appointment\r\n Term of\r\n ofce\r\n expires\r\n Length of\r\nservice\r\n on the\r\n Board \r\nPatrick Pouyanné \r\nChairman and \r\nChief Executive Officer\r\n 55 M 127,617 1 2015 2021 4 4\r\nPatrick Artus 67 M 1,000 2 4 2009 2021 10 4\r\nPatricia Barbizet \r\nLead Independent Director\r\n 63 F 1,050 4 4 2008 2020 11 4\r\nMarie- Christine Coisne- Roquette 62 F 4,472 1 4 2011 2020 8 4\r\nMark Cutifani 60 M 2,000 1 4 2017 2020 2 4\r\nMaria van der Hoeven 69 F 1,000 2 4 2016 2019 3 4\r\nAnne-Marie Idrac 67 F 1,250 4 4 2012 2021 7 4\r\nGérard Lamarche 57 M 3,064 4 4 2012 2019 7 4\r\nJean Lemierre 68 M 1,042 1 4 2016 2019 3 4\r\nRenata Perycz \r\nDirector representing \r\nemployee shareholders \r\n55 F 549 0 n/a 2016 2019 3 4\r\nChristine Renaud \r\nDirector representing employees \r\n 50 F 200 0 n/a 2017 2020 2 4\r\nCarlos Tavares 60 M 1,000 2 4 2017 2020 2 4\r\n(a) Number of directorships held by the director at listed companies outside his or her group, including foreign companies, assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the\r\nAFEP- MEDEF Code, point 18 (refer to point 4.1.1.3 of chapter 4). \r\nOverview of the Committees \r\nAs of March 13, 2019 \r\nAudit Committee \r\nGovernance and \r\nEthics Committee\r\nCompensation\r\nCommittee \r\nStrategy & CSR Audit\r\nCommittee \r\n4 members 4 members 5 members 6 members \r\n100% independent 100% independent 100% independent(a) 80% independent(a) \r\nMarie- Christine Coisne- Roquette* Patricia Barbizet* Gérard Lamarche* Patrick Pouyanné* \r\nPatrick Artus Mark Cutifani Patricia Barbizet Patrick Artus \r\nMaria van der Hoeven Anne- Marie Idrac Marie- Christine Coisne- Roquette Patricia Barbizet \r\nGérard Lamarche Jean Lemierre Renata Perycz (b) Anne-Marie Idrac \r\nCarlos Tavares Jean Lemierre \r\nChristine Renaud(c) \r\n(a) Excluding the director representing employee shareholders and the director representing employees, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code (point 8.3). \r\n(b) Director representing employee shareholders. \r\n(c) Director representing employees. \r\n* Chairperson of the Committee. \r\nActivities of the Board of Directors and of the Committees in 2018 \r\n10 meetings of\r\nthe Board of Directors\r\n95%average\r\nBoard meeting attendance \r\nrate of the directors \r\n1 executive session\r\nchaired by the Lead \r\nIndependent Director\r\n7 Audit Committee\r\nmeetings \r\n100% attendance \r\n3 Governance and Ethics\r\nCommittee meetings \r\n91.7% attendance \r\n2 Compensation\r\nCommittee meetings\r\n100% attendance \r\n3Strategy & CSR\r\nCommittee meetings \r\n100% attendance \r\nThe duties and work of the Board of Directors and of its Committees are described in point 4.1.2 of chapter 4. \r\nTOTAL Registration Document 2018 \n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/TotalEnergies/TotalEnergies_2018.pdf', 'page': 7})]","Summarize the company's performances and future plans based on the CEO's letter.

Summarize the company's performances and future plans according to the CEO's letter: /n {text} /n SUMMARY:,"[Document(page_content='BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019 3\r\nStrategic report\r\nDear fellow shareholders,\r\nAs I write, the world is facing an \r\nunprecedented set of challenges. The \r\ncoronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is \r\nspreading rapidly, with tragic consequences \r\nfor many people across many geographies. \r\nGlobal efforts to stop the virus are also \r\nhaving significant economic consequences. \r\nAnd in an oil market where demand has \r\nfallen, supply has sharply increased.\r\nThough unprecedented, a global energy \r\ncompany like BP should be prepared for \r\nsuch challenges. \r\nBP is indeed prepared. Our global \r\noperating structure and long time\ufffehorizons are intended to mitigate the \r\neffect of near-term shocks. That is how \r\nBP has approached shocks and volatility \r\nin its 110-year history, and that is how \r\nwe will approach this storm too. In \r\nparticular, the past decade has given \r\nBP unique experience in successfully \r\nhandling crises – and we enter this one \r\neven better prepared.\r\nBut in this world of change, BP itself is also \r\nchanging. We enter a new decade with a \r\nnew company purpose: to reimagine \r\nenergy for people and our planet. We have \r\nalso set a new ambition: to become a net \r\nzero company by 2050 or sooner, and to \r\nhelp the world get to net zero. And to lead \r\nand deliver on both we have a new chief \r\nexecutive officer, Bernard Looney, who \r\ntook on the role on 5 February 2020. \r\nEvolving for an uncertain world\r\nThis is a new direction for BP, and it is only \r\npossible because of the foundation laid by \r\nBob Dudley. Bob served as BP’s group \r\nchief executive with distinction for almost \r\na decade, and he and his team deserve \r\nour considerable thanks for guiding BP to \r\na position of operational and financial \r\nstrength and deepened resilience.\r\nAt these times, BP’s 110-year history of \r\nnavigating uncertainty is also reassuring. \r\nYour company has anticipated and \r\nresponded to change many times over. \r\nIndeed, throughout 2019 your board has \r\nfocused on evolving BP’s strategy and \r\nportfolio to address the challenges of \r\ntomorrow. This focus has included \r\nensuring the smooth transition in \r\nleadership from Bob to Bernard, followed \r\nby regular engagement by the board with \r\nBernard and his new leadership team to \r\ndevelop BP’s purpose and net zero \r\nambition. This is a process which has \r\nbeen supported by our dialogue with \r\ninvestors, governments, employees \r\nand other key stakeholders.\r\nOur enduring commitments\r\nBP is now set for a future that is different \r\nto its past, but some things won’t change. \r\nBP’s values-based culture will be maintained \r\nand further developed. BP’s purpose and \r\nambition reflect its culture, and together \r\nthey position BP well to develop as an \r\nincreasingly sustainable company. \r\nOur commitment to safe and reliable \r\noperations will remain paramount. BP’s \r\nsafety performance has seen near \r\ncontinuous improvement since 2010, and \r\nwe must continue to learn and improve. \r\nWe believe that the new organizational \r\nstructure BP set out last month will help \r\nto reinforce this commitment.\r\nAs well as our enduring commitment \r\nto safety, BP’s commitment to its \r\nrelationships and partnerships will not \r\nchange, including with governments \r\naround the world. BP intends to use its \r\nenergy market experience, skills and \r\ntechnology to help countries, cities and \r\ncorporations decarbonize, while at the \r\nsame time building a thriving, lower \r\ncarbon energy business. \r\nBP’s new ambition also gives us extra \r\nreason to maintain the capital discipline \r\nand focus that has served the company so \r\nwell. We can only reimagine energy if we \r\ngenerate the cash needed to manage the \r\nbalance sheet, invest in new low carbon \r\nbusinesses, and continue to pay the \r\ndividend on which you, our owners, depend. \r\nThat is how we will meet our ambition. It is \r\nsomething that I, together with the BP \r\nboard, look forward to working on with \r\nBernard and his executive team.\r\nOur focus throughout 2020\r\nOne of the focal points for the board in \r\n2020 will be BP’s capital markets day \r\nin September, when Bernard and his \r\nleadership team will lay out more detail \r\nabout the strategy, near-term targets and \r\nways to measure progress. It will be the \r\nmoment the vision and ambition set out in \r\nFebruary becomes much more concrete. \r\nWe will do this while ensuring that we \r\nmaintain a strong focus on high quality and \r\nefficient operations and on delivering the \r\npromises we have made to our investors\r\nMy thanks to you all\r\nIn addition to thanking Bob, two other \r\ndeparting senior leaders deserve a special \r\nmention – chief financial officer Brian \r\nGilvary, who has decided to step down from \r\nthe board in June after eight years in the job, \r\nand Downstream chief executive Tufan \r\nErginbilgic, who leaves BP at the end of \r\nMarch. On behalf of the board, I extend my \r\nthanks and my deep appreciation for the \r\nprofound contributions they each made \r\nduring an important period for the company. \r\nOf course, each of our employees has a \r\nvery important role to play in BP’s progress, \r\nand they should be recognized. On behalf \r\nof the board I extend my sincere thanks to \r\nall our people for a job well done in 2019.\r\nToday, BP’s engagement with its \r\ncustomers, suppliers, shareholders, \r\nemployees and others is wider and deeper \r\nthan ever, but it has to further develop as \r\nwe progress on our journey. I therefore want \r\nto use this opportunity to thank you, BP \r\nshareholders, for your continued support \r\nand engagement during 2019, including \r\nthrough your votes at our AGM in May. Your \r\nchallenge and input have been important in \r\nour effort to set a new strategic direction. \r\nI look forward to continuing our dialogue.\r\nHelge Lund\r\nChairman\r\n18 March 2020\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/BP PLC/BP PLC_2019.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='4 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019\r\nChief executive \r\nofficer’s letter\r\nDear fellow shareholders,\r\nAs we publish this report, the world is \r\nworking through extraordinarily difficult \r\ntimes. Countries around the globe are \r\nbattling the coronavirus pandemic \r\n(COVID-19). People’s lives are being \r\nhugely disrupted, with tragic \r\nconsequences for many. The financial \r\nmarkets are reflecting the disruption and \r\nour sector is particularly hard hit, not just \r\nby a virus-related shock to demand but by \r\na supply-side shock as well. \r\nAt BP, we are taking calm and deliberate \r\nactions for the well-being of our people \r\nand the health of your company. We do \r\nso with a robust balance sheet, strong \r\nliquidity and the flexibility in our portfolio \r\nand financial framework that provide us \r\nwith options. \r\nA resilient company\r\nThis resilience is a tribute to Bob Dudley’s \r\nleadership over the past decade. \r\nFollowing the Deepwater Horizon \r\naccident, Bob’s steady hand has guided \r\nBP through recovery and back to growth \r\nas a safer, stronger and more disciplined \r\ncompany – one that has delivered \r\nconsistently for 12 consecutive quarters \r\non the plan we put forward in 2017.\r\n• We made an underlying profit of \r\n$10 billion in 2019.\r\n• Operating cash flow was strong at \r\n$26 billion for the year.\r\n• That gave us the confidence to increase \r\nour dividend, which currently stands at \r\n10.5c per ordinary share.\r\nDuring 2019, two colleagues sadly lost \r\ntheir lives while working at BP. My heart \r\ngoes out to their families and friends. We \r\nmust learn from these tragedies and \r\ncontinue to make BP safer. I believe that \r\nwe can build on progress that last year \r\nsaw our lowest-ever figure for BP people \r\ngetting hurt at work (our recordable injury \r\nfrequency measure). \r\nReimagining and reinventing energy\r\nIn February, we announced a new \r\npurpose for BP, and a major reorganization \r\nto deliver our new ambition to be a net \r\nzero company by 2050 or sooner and help \r\nthe world get to net zero. \r\nThe current market shocks only reaffirm \r\nthe need for this reimagining of energy and \r\nreinvention of BP. Our current upstream\ufffedownstream structure has served us well \r\nfor over a century, but I believe we now \r\nneed a different model for the rapidly \r\nchanging demands of the future. We need \r\nan agile, highly integrated structure that is \r\nmore focused than ever on our core \r\ncapabilities in operations, customers, low \r\ncarbon and innovation. The leadership team \r\nis working with the board to develop this \r\nstructure, along with a new strategy and \r\nnear-term targets, which we intend to \r\nshare with you in September 2020.\r\nI see huge opportunity for BP given our \r\ndistinctive combination of reach, \r\nresources and relationships. The world will \r\nneed to invest trillions of dollars in new \r\nenergies over the next several decades. \r\nWe have the skill and the will to help the \r\nworld deliver a rapid energy transition. \r\nPerforming while transforming\r\nThis may be our most wide-ranging \r\nreorganization for more than a century, but \r\nI want to assure you of our commitment \r\nto perform as we transform. Among many \r\nsignificant changes, however, there will be \r\nno change to the fundamental principles \r\nthat have served us well over the last \r\ndecade and which apply equally in low \r\nprice environments as well as high.\r\nAbove all, our commitment to safe and \r\nreliable operations remains unchanged. \r\nSafety will always be a BP core value and \r\nwe believe that the new structure we are \r\nintroducing will further strengthen our \r\nsafety performance.\r\nOur investor proposition will remain \r\nunchanged as we lay out new near-term \r\nplans later this year. This includes our \r\ncommitment to growing sustainable free \r\ncash flow and returns to shareholders \r\nover the long term.\r\nWe will continue to maintain a strong \r\nfinancial frame, including a focus on \r\ndeleveraging our balance sheet and \r\nstaying within a disciplined frame for our \r\ncapital expenditure. \r\nAnd now, more than ever, we will focus \r\non managing costs, pursuing efficiencies \r\nand driving waste out of the system.\r\nA force for good and competitive returns \r\nThis new decade is a pivotal time for BP. \r\nWe will continue to be an energy business, \r\nbut a very different kind of energy business \r\nin years to come. We may not get \r\neverything right along the way and will \r\nneed to listen and learn from others, not \r\nleast you, our owners.\r\nBut with your continued support we \r\nexpect to become leaner, faster-moving, \r\nlower carbon – and more valuable. \r\nOur destination is a thriving, sustainable \r\nenergy business in a net zero world.

Our \r\nbroad and diverse growth portfolio, which leads the \r\nindustry, is capable of generating returns even at the \r\nbottom of the commodity price cycle, as we capture \r\nvalue in a favorable cost environment.\r\nIn 2019, we saw commodity prices and margins drop \r\nto near 10-year lows due to near-term oversupply \r\nacross the industry. Despite these challenges, we \r\ngenerated $14 billion in earnings and increased the \r\ndividend for the 37th consecutive year, invested in \r\nfuture growth, and continued our work to develop \r\nnew technology solutions to manage the risks \r\nrelated to climate change.\r\nAcross each of our business lines, we made progress \r\non our growth strategy. \r\nIn the Upstream, the Liza Phase 1 development \r\noffshore Guyana started production less than five \r\nyears from initial discovery – about half the industry \r\naverage for projects of this scale. We’re working to \r\nbring on more production in Guyana over the next \r\nfew years, and our exploration success increased \r\nthe estimated recoverable resource to more than \r\n8 billion oil-equivalent barrels. \r\n“Our growth strategy to significantly improve earnings and cash flow \r\ngeneration is underpinned by long-term industry fundamentals”\r\nEXXONMOBIL 2019 SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\r\n4\r\n| LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/ExxonMobil/ExxonMobil_2019.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='In the Permian Basin, we grew unconventional \r\nproduction by almost 80 percent in 2019, while \r\nbuilding out logistics and infrastructure to support a \r\nuniquely integrated development approach. Our plan \r\ncaptures additional value for shareholders by linking \r\nour producing assets to our refineries and chemical \r\nmanufacturing operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast. \r\nElsewhere in the Upstream, we drilled six deepwater \r\ndiscoveries, expanded exploration opportunities in \r\nBrazil, and advanced LNG projects in Mozambique \r\nand Papua New Guinea.\r\nWe invested in our Downstream business to improve \r\nthe competitiveness and earnings growth potential of \r\nour refining network, and recently completed projects \r\nin Antwerp, Beaumont, and Rotterdam generated \r\n$300 million in earnings in a challenging margin \r\nenvironment. \r\nOur Chemical business expanded capacity to \r\ncapture demand growth. Eight growth projects are \r\ncomplete, and funding was approved for another \r\nfour. Construction and expansion of manufacturing \r\nprojects along the Texas and Louisiana coast gained \r\nmomentum with start-up of the Beaumont high\ufffeperformance polyethylene plant and ground breaking \r\nfor a steam cracker and derivative product lines near \r\nCorpus Christi, Texas. \r\nThe strength of our balance sheet enabled us to make \r\nmany of these investments during the down cycle, \r\ntaking advantage of an attractive cost environment. \r\nThese investments are critical given projected energy \r\nand product demand growth in the coming decades \r\nand natural decline rates associated with producing \r\nassets. In fact, the International Energy Agency \r\nestimates in their Stated Policies Scenario that nearly \r\n$20 trillion of additional oil and natural gas investment \r\nis needed by 2040, just to keep pace with demand \r\nand avoid a shortfall in supply.\r\nAs we grow our operations and build long-term \r\nshareholder value, we retain our strong commitment \r\nto maintaining a safe work environment and have \r\nachieved an almost 80-percent reduction in our \r\nlost-time incident rate since 2000.

It begins with \r\npeople – billions of people striving for improved \r\nliving standards around the world. \r\nThis relationship is illustrated in the graphic below. \r\nThe United Nations uses the Human Development \r\nIndex to assess key dimensions of human development, \r\nincluding health, education, and standards of living. \r\nThe chart illustrates the connection between these \r\nkey dimensions and per-capita energy consumption \r\nby country. \r\nThe size of the circle represents population size. \r\nIn general, as quality of life improves, energy \r\nconsumption increases.\r\nAffordable, reliable energy is therefore essential to \r\nfacilitate improvements in life expectancy, education, \r\nand gross national income per capita, regardless of \r\nwhere a person lives. Advancing billions of individuals \r\nto a living standard experienced by many in developed \r\nnations will require every available source of energy and \r\nsignificant investment. Restricting access to existing \r\nsources of affordable energy will adversely affect those \r\nin emerging economies the most, as it reduces supply \r\nand increases cost. \r\nConsider that today, half the world’s population has \r\na life expectancy 12 years less than those living in \r\nthe United States, and receives about a third less \r\neducation. Close to a billion people still live without \r\nelectricity.

First \r\nand foremost among these milestones was \r\nour initial public offering (IPO) and listing on \r\nthe Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), which \r\nprovided eligible investors the first-ever \r\nopportunity to directly take a stake in our \r\ncompany. Indeed, we are pleased to welcome \r\nall our new investors alongside our majority \r\nshareholder, the Government of Saudi Arabia.\r\nIn addition to completing the world’s largest \r\nIPO in 2019, we established our presence \r\nin\xa0the global capital markets through \r\na\xa0landmark US$12 billion inaugural \r\ninternational bond issuance earlier in the \r\nyear, as well as disclosing detailed financial, \r\noperational and reserves information for the \r\nfirst time in our history. The success of the \r\nTadawul listing and the response to our \r\nglobal debt offering were strong votes of \r\ninvestor confidence in Saudi Aramco’s track \r\nrecord and potential for continued growth.\r\nAnother important milestone specific to \r\nSaudi Aramco’s downstream strategy in 2019 \r\nwas the signing of the purchase agreement \r\nto acquire a majority equity interest in \r\nSaudi\xa0Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC). \r\nFollowing the expected closing of this \r\ntransaction in the first half of 2020, \r\nSaudi\xa0Aramco will be a major petrochemical \r\nproducer globally. \r\nOperationally, in 2019 Saudi Aramco also \r\ndemonstrated remarkable resilience in the \r\nface of unprecedented adversity following \r\nattacks on our facilities at Shaybah, Abqaiq \r\nand Khurais. Thankfully, in each of the \r\nincidents there were no fatalities and overall \r\noutput was reduced only temporarily due to \r\nthe extraordinary efforts of many individuals. \r\nFinancially, Saudi Aramco once again \r\ndelivered solid earnings and strong cash \r\nflows through consistent operational \r\nperformance, cost management and fiscal \r\ndiscipline. \r\nCareful stewardship\r\nIt has been almost nine decades since the \r\nKingdom granted an initial concession to \r\nexplore for oil across the remote sands of the \r\nArabian desert.

We are passionate about \r\npreserving the environment and are actively \r\nworking towards providing sustainable and \r\nprofitable growth, and increased value for \r\nour shareholders and customers. \r\nOf course, value creation means more \r\nthan\xa0just dollars generated or dividends \r\ndistributed – it is also measured by the \r\npositive contributions that a company makes \r\nto people, to communities and to the world \r\nas a whole. On this count, Saudi Aramco \r\ncontinues to excel by prudently managing the \r\nKingdom’s reserves while meeting the daily \r\nneeds of its customers around the world. \r\nWe are actively working \r\ntowards providing \r\nsustainable and profitable \r\ngrowth, and increased \r\nvalue for our shareholders \r\nand customers.”\r\n As the need for energy continues to rise, we\xa0\r\nseek to be a force for progress and opportunity, \r\nnot only by providing reliable energy, but also by \r\ninvesting in the sustainability of our business and \r\nthe world in which we all\xa0live\r\nchairman’s\r\nmessage \r\n06saudi aramco\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/Saudi Aramco/Saudi Aramco_2019.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content=' Saudi Aramco\r\nannounces \r\nits intention to \r\nfloat\xa0on Tadawul\r\nAs the need for energy continues to rise, \r\nwe\xa0seek to be a force for progress and \r\nopportunity, not only by providing reliable \r\nenergy, but also by investing in the sustainability \r\nof our business and the world in which we \r\nall\xa0live.

Green enterprise \r\nand energy efficiency upgrading campaigns were \r\nundertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \r\nand protect the ecological environment \r\nand biodiversity. We also took great care in \r\nimplementing our HSSE management system \r\nthat ensures safe production and occupational \r\nhealth, and protects the physical and mental \r\nhealth of all employees. We made greater \r\nefforts to implement targeted poverty alleviation \r\nand achieved fruitful results, including poverty \r\nalleviation programs focused on industry, \r\neducation and consumption. To benefit as many \r\npeople as possible, we actively and consistently \r\nparticipated in various social welfare initiatives. \r\nIn addition, we honored the traditional and \r\ncultural characteristics of the communities where \r\nwe operate, and regularly promoted economic \r\ndevelopment and environmental protection in the \r\ncommunities around our projects. In so doing, \r\nwe fully demonstrated our commitment to being \r\na responsible global corporate citizen, which \r\nreceived high recognition at home and abroad.\r\nThe hard-won achievements in 2019 were \r\nattributed to the arduous efforts and altruistic \r\ndedication of the Company’s Board of Directors, \r\nthe Board of Supervisors, the management \r\nand the entire staff. Due to reassignment \r\nand retirement, Mr. Dai Houliang, Mr. Li \r\nYunpeng, and Mr. Liu Zhongyun no longer hold \r\npositions in the Company. During their tenure, \r\nthey worked diligently, fulfilled their duties \r\nand contributed greatly to the Company. In \r\nparticular, Mr. Dai Houliang, former Chairman of \r\nthe Board, made outstanding contributions and \r\nplayed an essential role in improving corporate \r\ngovernance, advancing reforms and innovation, \r\nand achieving sustainable growth. On behalf of \r\nthe Board of Directors, I would like to extend my \r\nsincere gratitude to all of them!\r\nAt the beginning of 2020, the sudden outbreak \r\nof coronavirus struck China and impacted \r\nthe global economy. Confronted with the \r\noutbreak, President Xi Jinping attached great \r\nimportance to deploying relief actions by giving \r\noverall instructions directly. In response to the \r\noutbreak, the Company acted promptly and \r\nproactively. While maintaining stable production \r\nand operation, the Company gave full play to \r\nits industrial advantages, exerted full force to \r\nproduce raw materials for medical and health \r\nsupplies, and cooperated with related enterprises \r\nto produce medical supplies in urgent need, \r\nincluding masks and protective suits for affected \r\nareas. Moreover, with the advantages of our \r\nsales network, the Company spared no effort \r\nto guarantee the market supply of oil and gas, \r\ninnovate service models, and enable the public \r\nto purchase articles for daily use conveniently, \r\nthereby making our contribution to win the \r\nbattle against the virus.\r\nLooking forward, the global economy will face \r\nmore instability and uncertainty brought by the \r\noutbreak. Although the virus may temporarily \r\nimpact the Chinese economy, we firmly believe \r\nthat China’s solid economic fundamentals \r\nwill remain unchanged and the country’s \r\npotential and momentum will remain strong. \r\nA combination of preferential policies and \r\nmeasures oriented to enterprises set out by the \r\nChinese government is supporting the rapid \r\nrecovery of the economy while reducing the \r\nimpact brought by the virus. We believe that as \r\nthe control and prevention of outbreak continues \r\nto improve domestically, the domestic demand \r\nfor petroleum and petrochemical products that \r\nwas suppressed and frozen will rebound quickly.\r\nChallenges always arise with opportunities. The \r\nCompany will continue to adhere to the overall \r\nstrategy of “making progress while maintaining \r\nstability,” and to that end will implement new \r\ndevelopment philosophies and energy security \r\nstrategies, as well as further strengthen \r\ncorporate governance. The Company will also \r\ncontinue to focus on supply-side structural \r\nreform. Exercising comprehensive and strict \r\ngovernance over the Party, coupled with the \r\nstrategy of the Talent Empowering Enterprise \r\nScheme, the Company will continue to leverage \r\nits advantages of integration, aiming to realize \r\na development pattern with energy resources \r\nas the backbone, clean energy and synthetic \r\nmaterials as two development wings, and new \r\nenergy, new economies, and new fields as \r\nimportant growth points.\r\nThe Company will continue to deepen the \r\nreform of its systems and mechanisms, \r\nfurther improve its corporate governance \r\nsystem and enhance governance capabilities. \r\nWith headquarters acting as the center of \r\nrestructuring, the Company will further advance \r\nreforms of its management system and \r\nmarket-oriented operation mechanism. It will \r\nstrengthen construction of its systems, improve \r\nmanagement, and better mobilize initiatives in \r\nevery aspect so as to constantly increase the \r\nability to create synergies, raise efficiency and \r\nmitigate risks.\r\nThe Company will focus on promoting structural \r\nadjustment and continuously improving its \r\ncore competence. In the upstream business, \r\nthe Company will implement the action plan of \r\nvigorously enhancing oil and gas exploration \r\nand development, focusing on high-quality \r\nexploration and profit-driven production, and \r\nfurther consolidating the oil and gas resource \r\nbase. In the meantime, the Company will adopt \r\nan integrated approach to the clean and efficient \r\nuse of new energy, renewable energy and coal \r\nresources, and promote diversification of the \r\nenergy mix. As for the refining and marketing \r\nbusiness, the Company will closely monitor \r\nmarket demand, optimize the system, promote \r\nconstruction of advanced production capacity, \r\nand fully develop the potential of the marketing \r\nnetwork and improve the quality of operations. \r\nIn terms of the chemicals business, the \r\nCompany will accelerate the supply of high-end \r\nsynthetic materials, develop a more competitive \r\nand advantageous basic chemical product \r\nchain and improve marketing services and \r\nefficiency, by ways of focusing on technological \r\nprogress and extending the production chain, \r\netc.Additionally, the Company will accelerate \r\nkey research on core technologies, enhance the \r\ncapability of proprietary innovation, speed up \r\nlow-carbon transformation, and improve the \r\nefficiency of energy conversion to reduce carbon \r\nemissions, which we expect will give rise to a \r\ncore competency in green development.

At bp, our thoughts are with the \r\nfamilies and loved ones of the colleagues we \r\nhave lost. Thousands more on our teams have \r\nhad the virus, and life under lockdown has meant \r\nadditional challenges, and anxiety for everyone. \r\nI want to pay particular tribute to those on the \r\nfrontline of our business who have kept our plants \r\nand platforms running, our shops and forecourts \r\nopen, and energy flowing to the world. They \r\nhave sacrificed so much and earned our deepest \r\nrespect and appreciation. \r\nResponding to brutal conditions \r\nWe began our transformation from an \r\nInternational Oil Company to an Integrated \r\nEnergy Company against this backdrop, along \r\nwith lower oil and gas prices, lower refining \r\nmargins and unprecedented falls in demand for \r\nour retail and aviation fuels. Our response \r\nincluded lowering costs, strengthening the \r\nbalance sheet with an innovative hybrid bond \r\nissue, and advancing our strategy to become \r\nI want to pay particular tribute \r\nto those on the frontline of our \r\nbusiness who have kept our \r\nplants and platforms running, \r\nour shops and forecourts \r\nopen, and energy flowing\r\nto the world.\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/BP PLC/BP PLC_2020.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='07\r\nStrategic report\r\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020\r\na more diversified, resilient and lower carbon \r\ncompany. As part of our strategy planning \r\nprocess, we reviewed our portfolio and \r\ndevelopment plans. This work – informed by \r\nbp’s views of the long-term price environment \r\n– led to significant impairment charges and \r\nnon-cash exploration write-offs in the \r\nsecond quarter. \r\nFor shareholders, all this was reflected in a reset \r\ndividend and a diminished share price. I recognize \r\nthe financial impact this must have had on you. \r\nHowever, I wholeheartedly believe we will not \r\njust restore, but will enhance the long-term \r\nsustainable value of your company through \r\nthe actions we are taking to reinvent bp. And \r\ndespite the most brutal operating conditions \r\nI can remember in almost 30 years in this \r\nindustry, we have made considerable \r\noperational and strategic progress. \r\nPerforming while transforming \r\nThe loss of $20.3 billion we reported for the \r\nyear is clearly disappointing. However, it in no \r\nway reflects the heroic efforts of the bp team in \r\nextremely difficult circumstances, or their deep \r\ncommitment to performing while transforming:\r\nMost importantly – our safety performance \r\ncontinued to improve. \r\nReliability of 94% for bp’s operated plants«\r\nand refining availability« of 96% represents \r\nremarkably strong performance, especially \r\ngiven the challenges faced by our \r\nfrontline staff. \r\nCapital was reset and we delivered at the \r\nlower end of the range. \r\nWe made good progress towards our net \r\ndebt« target, including the contribution from \r\nhigh grading our portfolio and $6.6 billion of \r\ndivestment and other proceeds received \r\nduring the year. \r\nNew oil and gas production came on from \r\nfour major projects« – in India, Oman, the \r\nUK and the US. \r\nNatural gas from the Shah Deniz field in \r\nthe Caspian Sea arrived in Italy following \r\nfinal completion of the historic Southern \r\nGas Corridor project.\r\nAnd we doubled our retail network in growth \r\nmarkets to around 2,700 retail sites«, \r\nplus the addition of around 300 strategic \r\nconvenience sites«.\r\nReinventing bp \r\nThis performance is even more remarkable given \r\nthat we have been carrying out the most \r\nextensive reorganization in bp’s 112-year history. \r\nWe have retired the upstream/downstream \r\nbusiness model that has served bp very well. \r\nIn its place we have introduced a leaner, flatter \r\nstructure, stripping away tiers of management \r\nand lowering the workforce towards a target of \r\naround 10,000 fewer jobs. My role is now five \r\nlayers at most away from more than half of our \r\nemployees. That means people’s ideas and \r\nvoices can be more easily heard – and decisions \r\ntaken much faster. \r\nWe are now more centralized, more agile, and \r\nbetter integrated. This enables us to maximize \r\nvalue creation in a rapidly evolving market through \r\neconomies of scale, and by exploiting synergies \r\nand driving continuous improvement in \r\noperational performance. \r\nWe are now organized around four business groups.\r\nProduction & operations is the operating heart \r\nof the company – and is focusing our resilient \r\nhydrocarbons portfolio on value. \r\nCustomers & products is growing our \r\nconvenience and mobility offers for an \r\nincreasing number of customers. \r\nGas & low carbon energy is growing to help \r\nmeet rapidly increasing clean energy demand. \r\nInnovation & engineering acts as a catalyst, \r\nopening up new and disruptive business \r\nmodels and driving our digital transformation. \r\nAnd our trading & shipping business and \r\nregions, cities & solutions team knit together \r\nthe offers of our four core groups to drive \r\ngreater value creation. \r\nReimagining energy \r\nCompleting our transformation to a net zero \r\nIntegrated Energy Company will take time. But \r\nwe are led by our purpose – to reimagine energy \r\nfor people and our planet – and motivated by the \r\nopportunity we see in the energy transition. \r\nTrillions of dollars of investment will be needed \r\nover the next 30 years in replumbing and rewiring \r\nthe global energy system. \r\nWe now have offshore wind partnerships in\r\nthe US with Equinor and in the UK with EnBW \r\n– two of the best regions globally for the world’s \r\nfastest-growing source of energy. Our solar \r\ndevelopment joint venture«, Lightsource bp, is \r\ngrowing prolifically. We are working with Ørsted \r\nto develop green hydrogen for our Lingen \r\nrefinery. We have joined forces with the mobility \r\nplatform DiDi to build a network of electric \r\nvehicle chargers in China, by far the world’s \r\nbiggest market for EVs.

At the same time, we are transforming \r\nto create value from the energy transition over \r\nthe long term. \r\nWe see tremendous business opportunity in \r\nproviding people with the reliable, affordable, \r\nclean energy they want and need. Our net \r\nzero ambition is clearly the right thing for society, \r\nbut we know it does not give us a free pass in a \r\nfast-changing world. We have to show you the \r\nevidence that we can compete fiercely and add \r\nvalue – in service of the compelling investor \r\nproposition we believe we offer: \r\nCommitted distributions – including the \r\ndividend as the number one priority; \r\nProfitable growth; and \r\nSustainable value. \r\nThis is all in service of growing long-term \r\nshareholder value, that is our job. And I promise \r\nto keep you well informed as we execute our \r\nplans. As ever, thank you for your continued \r\nsupport – I will never take that for granted.

As the COVID-19 \r\npandemic took hold in the UK,\r\nthe bp North Sea team quickly \r\nimplemented wide-ranging \r\nand robust COVID-19-specific \r\nmeasures to protect the safety and \r\nwellbeing of offshore colleagues. \r\nThe ‘Safe Passage’ programme \r\nwas introduced during the first UK \r\nlockdown to help individuals travel \r\nto Aberdeen for mobilization as \r\nsafely as possible. The programme \r\nprovided door-to-door transport, \r\naccommodation during the journey \r\nto Aberdeen and hotels in the \r\ncity dedicated to bp staff \r\nand contractors.\r\nWe introduced pre-mobilization \r\nCOVID-19 testing in Aberdeen, \r\none of the first operators in the \r\nNorth Sea to do this.

Our actions were proactive and disciplined – \r\nsimplifying and modernizing work; integrating teams, processes and value chains across business units and geographies; elevating \r\nleadership capabilities; advancing digital solutions; and empowering our workforce to make decisions quickly, safely and with \r\ngreater accountability. \r\nWe leveraged our strengths to design a better company for the long term – one that can act deliberately, seize opportunity and \r\ngenerate stronger returns. And we remained true to our values, prepared to succeed in any environment, and adaptive in a dynamic \r\nworld where disruption is routine. \r\nOur fnancial priorities have not changed: \r\ngrowing \r\nthe dividend \r\nWhile others are lowering dividends, we have maintained ours \r\nas we know it is a vital source of stockholder income. In 2020, we \r\nincreased our payout 8 percent, the 33rd consecutive annual \r\nincrease in per-share dividend payout. \r\nmaintaining a strong \r\nbalance sheet \r\nFinancial strength – demonstrated by our industry-leading \r\nnet debt ratio – gives us the fexibility to navigate uncertain \r\nmarket conditions and address emerging opportunities. \r\nreinvesting to \r\ngrow\xa0future\xa0cash fows \r\nImproving capital efciency allows us to sustain our future \r\nat a lower reinvestment rate. The Noble Energy acquisition is \r\nexpected to generate free cash fow and added $13 billion in \r\nenterprise value. \r\nreturning excess \r\ncash to stockholders \r\nAfter meeting the frst three priorities, we return excess cash \r\nto stockholders through buybacks. We have repurchased \r\nshares in 13 of the last 17 years, including returning $1.75 billion \r\nto stockholders in 2020. \r\nOur priorities anchor our commitment to deliver higher returns. They guide us in good times – and we stand by them in difcult \r\ntimes. They dictate a disciplined approach to capital allocation. They inform actions to strengthen our already advantaged \r\nportfolio through smart acquisitions and prudent divestments – focusing on assets that deliver higher returns. Our success in \r\nreliably delivering value for stockholders will be commemorated this year when we celebrate a full century on the New York Stock \r\nExchange – one of only 29 companies to reach this milestone. \r\noperating with resilience \r\nDuring 2020, global oil demand fell by some 9 percent, while \r\nnatural gas demand fell by a more modest 3 percent. Stress \r\nin energy markets was compounded by intense competition \r\nfor market share among the world’s key oil producers. These \r\ndisruptions occurred against the backdrop of geopolitical \r\nuncertainty and growing economic distress. \r\nWe demonstrated both resilience and agility in adjusting to \r\nextreme market conditions, balancing short-term cash fow \r\nand long-term value. Our portfolio is anchored in businesses \r\nthat are low cost, large scale and long-lived – from our royalty\ufffeadvantaged position in the Permian and growing natural \r\ngas business in the Eastern Mediterranean to our feedstock\ufffeadvantaged chemicals business and leading fuels brands on \r\nthe U.S. West Coast. We expect to deliver results through the \r\nbusiness cycle, creating greater value for our stockholders and \r\nstronger cash fow for decades. \r\nWhen market conditions deteriorated in 2020, we swiftly \r\nreduced capital spending by 35 percent from 2019. We also \r\nreduced operating costs, refecting our commitment to \r\nboth capital and cost discipline. In the Permian Basin, we \r\ndemonstrated our fexibility to cut short-cycle capital. At the \r\nsame time, we redoubled internal transformation eforts to \r\nbecome more agile, cost efcient and streamlined. \r\nIn our Upstream business, the acquisition of Noble Energy \r\nadded complementary high-quality assets in Texas’s \r\nPermian Basin, Colorado’s DJ Basin and the Eastern \r\nMediterranean. Portfolio additions in 2020 included \r\napproximately 5.67\xa0million net exploration acres. We added \r\n832 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves \r\nin 2020, with the largest net additions coming from the \r\nNoble\xa0Energy\xa0acquisition. \r\nDespite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, \r\nwe advanced construction of the Future Growth Project\ufffeWellhead Pressure Management Project at Tengizchevroil \r\nin Kazakhstan. Over three years, we safely delivered by sea \r\n408\xa0modules, many of which weighed between 500 and \r\n1,800 tons, to the Tengiz Field from fabrication sites in Italy, \r\nKazakhstan and South Korea. \r\nChevron Corporation 2020 Annual Report \r\nIII\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/Chevron/Chevron_2020.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='1149230_Annual_Report_v8.3_r1.indd 4 3/12/21 10:37 AM\r\n\xa0 \xa0\r\nIn our Downstream business, we completed the acquisition \r\nof Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty Ltd., adding a \r\nnetwork of more than 360 company- and retailer-owned \r\nservice stations, a commercial and industrial fuels business, \r\nowned and leased seaboard import terminals and fuel \r\ndistribution depots. And we made excellent progress on \r\nGS Caltex’s olefns mixed-feed cracker project at the Yeosu \r\nRefnery in South Korea. \r\nIn 2020, we also increased production of renewable products \r\nand investments in low-carbon technologies, consistent \r\nwith our energy transition strategy to help advance a lower\ufffecarbon future. During the year, Chevron announced frst gas \r\nproduction at our CalBioGas renewable natural gas (RNG) \r\njoint venture in California, formed a new RNG partnership with \r\nBrightmark and announced frst production of renewable base \r\noil through a joint venture with Novvi. \r\nDuring a year of unprecedented challenges, we also delivered \r\none of our safest years ever. This refects our commitment to \r\nprotecting people and the environment – and our unwavering \r\ndetermination to keep getting better. \r\nadvancing a lower-carbon future \r\nHelping advance a lower-carbon future requires actions that \r\ndrive measurable progress, demonstrating the improvements \r\nwe are making today and our intention to do more tomorrow. \r\nOur energy transition strategy focuses on three action areas: \r\ny We are reducing the carbon intensity of our operations \r\nand assets, prioritizing the projects that return the largest \r\nreduction in carbon emissions at the lowest cost to \r\ncustomers and society. \r\ny We are increasing renewables and ofsets in support of \r\nour business. \r\ny And we are investing in low-carbon technologies to enable \r\ncommercial solutions while leveraging our capabilities \r\nand operations to advance technologies such as carbon \r\ncapture and hydrogen. \r\nThese actions will help make energy and global supply chains \r\nmore sustainable – so industries and customers who use our \r\nproducts can work toward building a lower-carbon world. \r\nlooking ahead \r\nWe are coming out of a year like none other: a global pandemic; \r\na historic lockdown of economic activity; and unprecedented \r\ndisruption in energy markets. \r\nYet the greatest challenges can call forth the greatest responses. \r\nThrough the power of innovation, markets and partnership, \r\nscientists developed multiple COVID-19 vaccines in record time. \r\nThe tide is beginning to turn, and the pandemic will eventually \r\nrecede. This inspiring example points the way to meeting other \r\ngreat challenges – eliminating poverty, creating prosperity for \r\nall and delivering the sustainable environment everyone desires. \r\nOn this foundation of hope, optimism and confdence, we can \r\nwork together to achieve an even brighter future. \r\nAt Chevron, our people are helping to build this future, \r\nproviding the afordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy that \r\nbillions of people rely on every day. We take great pride in \r\nenabling human progress around the world.

Yet, as is often the case, hardships bring \r\nout the best in people, as exemplified by the thousands \r\nof frontline workers, first responders and medical \r\nprofessionals who are battling the virus.\r\nAn exceptional commitment was also displayed \r\nby thousands of ExxonMobil employees around \r\nthe world who responded to the pandemic by \r\nserving their communities. I’m proud of the way they \r\nstepped up and made contributions to those in need \r\nof our products, from hand sanitizer and specialty \r\nproducts for protective equipment to fuel for \r\nfirst responders. Through extraordinary efforts, \r\nwe kept operations running 24/7 while achieving \r\nstrong safety and reliability performance.\r\nThe impact of the pandemic on our business was \r\nsevere. As economies shut down, energy consumption \r\ncollapsed. For the first time in memory, all of our \r\nbusinesses faced simultaneous lows. \r\nWe adjusted our capital investment plans, \r\nreducing spending last year by more than 30 percent, \r\nand developed future plans more flexible to market \r\nconditions and focused on priority areas that will \r\ndeliver the strongest returns. These include our \r\nhigh-performance chemical projects, refinery upgrades \r\nand, in the Upstream, our advantaged assets in Guyana, \r\nthe Permian Basin, and Brazil. \r\nOur recent reorganizations along value chains enabled \r\nus to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies\r\nto better position ourselves for the future. Structural \r\nchanges during the year resulted in reduced cash \r\noperating expenses of $3 billion. These savings grow \r\nto $6 billion a year by 2023 compared to 2019.1\r\nWe also continued to make strong progress on our\r\nplans to mitigate climate risk and position the \r\ncompany for success in a lower-carbon energy future. \r\nWe met emission-reduction goals for methane and \r\nflaring and established new plans that are projected to \r\nbe consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.2\r\nOur forward plans are expected to reduce absolute \r\nUpstream greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated \r\n30 percent by 2025 compared to 2016, and by the end \r\nof the decade, deliver industry-leading greenhouse gas \r\nperformance and align our Upstream operations with \r\nthe World Bank’s initiative to eliminate routine flaring.3\r\nOther notable milestones in 2020 include:\r\n• Our active Board refreshment program continued \r\nwith two new directors added by the end of January \r\n2021, which brings to six the number of independent \r\ndirectors added since 2015. In recent years the \r\ncompany has pursued additional board expertise \r\nin climate science, asset and risk management, and \r\nrelevant industry experience. The average tenure for \r\nour directors is about six years, compared to an average \r\nof about eight years for companies in the S&P 500.\r\n• In Guyana, Liza Phase 2 and Payara developments \r\nprogressed, and we continued exploration success \r\nwith three new discoveries, increasing the recoverable \r\nresource estimate on the Stabroek Block to nearly \r\n9 billion oil-equivalent barrels.\r\n• The Chemical business set a new record for \r\npolyethylene sales, reflecting demand growth \r\nfor performance packaging and strong operating \r\nperformance.\r\n| LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN\r\nII\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/ExxonMobil/ExxonMobil_2020.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='• We maintained our position as a global leader in \r\ncarbon capture and storage (CCS), increasing captured \r\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) to more than 120 million tonnes. \r\nThis is well over twice the closest competitor and larger \r\nthan the next five competitors combined.4\r\nMore recently, we announced the creation of a new \r\nbusiness – ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions – to \r\ncommercialize our extensive low-carbon technology \r\nportfolio and help society achieve the climate goals \r\noutlined in the Paris Agreement. This new business \r\nbuilds on the work of our Carbon Capture and Storage \r\nVenture established in 2018.\r\nThe business will initially concentrate on CCS, advancing \r\nplans for over 20 opportunities around the world \r\nto enable large-scale emission reductions. It will \r\nalso leverage ExxonMobil’s significant experience in \r\nhydrogen production and add other technology focus \r\nareas, such as advanced biofuels, as they mature to \r\ncommercialization.\r\nOur research and development program is continuing \r\nto pursue breakthrough technologies to address \r\nemissions in the economy’s highest-emitting \r\nsectors: power generation, industrial, and commercial \r\ntransportation. We plan to invest $3 billion in \r\nlower-emission energy solutions through 2025.5\r\nOver the past two decades, we have invested more \r\nthan $10 billion to research, develop, and deploy lower\ufffeemission energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient \r\noperations that have eliminated or avoided approximately \r\n480 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions as of \r\nyear-end 2019 – equivalent to the average annual energy \r\ndemand of more than 55 million U.S. homes.6\r\nNew technologies will be critically important in the future \r\nas the global economy and energy use recover.

Summarize the company's performances and future plans according to the CEO's letter: /n {text} /n SUMMARY:,"[Document(page_content='Dear Shareholders,\r\nIn 2020, no industry or company was \r\nimmune to the impacts of the COVID-19 \r\npandemic — including ours.\r\nAramco, for its part, demonstrated \r\nconsiderable financial and widespread \r\noperational agility during the most \r\nvolatile year the world has seen in \r\ngenerations. With the majority of our \r\nemployees working in field locations, we \r\nproactively put in place comprehensive \r\nprotective measures to safeguard their \r\nsafety and well-being, while maintaining \r\nour operational integrity and reliability. \r\nWith COVID-19 making daily work and \r\nlife more complex, we benefited from \r\nhaving previously adopted advanced \r\ntechnology and building a robust IT \r\ninfrastructure — all of which allowed \r\nus to adjust quickly and enabled our \r\nemployees who could work remotely, \r\nto do so. \r\nAs part of the battle against COVID-19, \r\nwe provided support for Saudi Arabia’s \r\nhealthcare sector, including donating \r\nventilators and other medical equipment \r\nand supplies. Our affiliates in Asia, \r\nEurope, and North America also engaged \r\nin similar initiatives.\r\nMaintaining financial resilience \r\nDespite the economic fallout of the \r\npandemic, we declared a dividend \r\nof SAR 281 billion ($75 billion) to our \r\nshareholders for the year. \r\nThroughout 2020, we demonstrated the \r\nagility of our financial framework through \r\nour spending and efficiency programs, \r\nwhich resulted in billions of dollars of \r\nsavings in both our capital and \r\noperational spend. We retain additional \r\nflexibility to further adjust expenditures. \r\nThe issuance of our $8 billion of Senior \r\nUnsecured Notes in the fourth quarter \r\nsaw exceptionally strong investor interest \r\nglobally, attracting more than 150 new \r\ninvestors and achieving record levels \r\nof demand for a new 50-year tranche — \r\nall of which we believe reflects confidence \r\nin our Company’s resilience. Indeed, we \r\nexpect long-term energy demand to \r\nincrease, with oil and gas remaining an \r\nimportant part of the global energy mix. \r\nDemonstrating operational \r\nflexibility \r\nDuring what can only be described as \r\nan exceptional year for the entire world, \r\nour upstream business demonstrated its \r\nunique flexibility by rapidly adjusting \r\nproduction levels as required. In April, \r\nwe achieved the highest single day crude \r\noil production in our history: 12.1 mmbpd. \r\nIn August, we achieved another \r\nmilestone, producing a single day record \r\nof 10.7 bscfd of natural gas from our \r\nconventional and unconventional fields. \r\nMeanwhile, our Fadhili Gas Plant reached \r\nits design processing capacity of 2.5 bscfd \r\nand we also resumed operations in the \r\noffshore partitioned territory between \r\nthe Kingdom and the State of Kuwait.\r\nWe operate one of the world’s largest \r\nrefining businesses, with our downstream \r\noperations consuming 39% of our crude \r\noil production in 2020. Our ambition to \r\nexpand further downstream also made \r\na significant leap forward with Aramco’s \r\nacquisition of a majority stake in SABIC. \r\nThe completion of this historic transaction \r\nin June transformed our Company into a \r\nmajor global petrochemicals player, with \r\noperations in more than 50 countries.\r\nWe are proud to be making a meaningful \r\ndifference by supplying vital energy to the world \r\ntoday, while working at the speed of science in \r\ndeveloping cleaner energy solutions for tomorrow\r\nPresident and\r\nCEO’s foreword\r\nThroughout its 87-year \r\nhistory, our Company has \r\novercome many challenges \r\nand we remain confident \r\nwewill emerge on the other \r\nside of this pandemic in \r\na position of strength.”\r\n08\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/Saudi Aramco/Saudi Aramco_2020.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='Creating additional value\r\nIn 2020, we added to the Kingdom’s oil \r\nand gas reserves with the discovery of \r\nseven new fields and one new reservoir.\r\nDuring the year, we also made \r\nrefinements to our business that further \r\nsupport our vision. This included the \r\nestablishment of a new corporate \r\ndevelopment unit to further optimize our \r\nportfolio and existing assets, while also \r\nidentifying new opportunities for growth \r\nthrough markets and technologies.\r\nOperationally, our iktva program to \r\ndevelop the local supply network and \r\nlower our procurement costs continued \r\nto prove beneficial, with the pandemic \r\nreinforcing the importance of having \r\na robust supply chain. \r\nIn November, we announced new \r\nagreements with companies through \r\nour Industrial Investment Program, \r\nwhich is designed to further support \r\nexpansion of the local business \r\necosystem. And in December, we also \r\nsigned agreements with Google and \r\nCognite that will help accelerate digital \r\ndevelopment within the Kingdom. \r\nDelivering more energy \r\nwith lower emissions\r\nWhile COVID-19 was certainly the biggest \r\ntest of the past year, reducing emissions \r\nto address climate change remains the \r\nbiggest single challenge of this century. \r\nGiven the fact that oil and gas will be \r\nrequired as sources of energy for many \r\ndecades to come, all roads to net zero \r\nrun through our industry. \r\nThe Company already has one of the \r\nlowest upstream carbon footprints in \r\nthe industry, achieving an upstream \r\ncarbon intensity of 10.5 kg of CO2 per \r\nbarrel of oil equivalent produced in 2020. \r\nIt should be noted that our low upstream \r\ncarbon intensity levels are not just a \r\ngeological perk, but also the result of our \r\ndecades-long reservoir management and \r\nproduction approach both below and \r\nabove the ground that includes leveraging \r\nadvanced technologies and minimizing \r\nemissions and flaring.\r\nAlthough we believe our low carbon \r\nenergy production will provide us with \r\na competitive edge, we recognize that \r\nwe must do much more to reduce our \r\nemissions. This includes investing in \r\ncarbon capture, utilization, and storage \r\ntechnologies, which — as the name \r\nsuggests — prevent more emissions \r\nentering the atmosphere. We are also \r\nworking on technologies that can turn \r\nCO2 into useful products or capture \r\nCO2 in cement. And we are pursuing \r\nnon-combustible alternative uses for \r\nhydrocarbons, including nonmetallic \r\nconstruction materials and direct \r\ncrude to chemicals technologies.\r\nAnother promising area is the conversion \r\nof hydrocarbons to hydrogen and then \r\nto ammonia, while capturing the CO2\r\ncreated during the process. In August, \r\nwe exported the world’s first shipment \r\nof high-grade blue ammonia to Japan \r\nfor use in zero carbon power generation, \r\nreinforcing another potential role that \r\nhydrocarbons could play in a circular \r\ncarbon economy. \r\nAs the result of our continued investment \r\nin innovation, we were granted a \r\ncompany record of 683 U.S. patents in \r\n2020, an accomplishment that places \r\nus among the leaders in our industry. \r\nWe believe that technology and \r\ninnovation are key to delivering more \r\nenergy more efficiently in the future. \r\nWe are pleased that our progress in \r\nthis area was once again acknowledged \r\nlast year, with the Khurais oil facility \r\nbecoming the second Aramco plant \r\nto be recognized by the World \r\nEconomic Forum for the adoption \r\nof cutting-edge technologies.\r\nEmerging even stronger\r\nThroughout its 87-year history, our \r\nCompany has overcome many challenges \r\nand we remain confident we will emerge \r\non the other side of this pandemic in \r\na position of strength. We believe \r\nAramco’s unique scale combined with \r\nour low-cost structure and low upstream \r\ncarbon intensity is unparalleled. \r\nI remain very proud of all my colleagues \r\nwho ensured reliable, safe, and normal \r\noperations even in these most abnormal \r\nof times.

The recession of 2020 was \r\nunprecedented. US oil prices briefly turned negative for the first \r\ntime\xa0in\xa0history.\r\nIn April, we faced a perfect storm. With vaccines not yet on the horizon, \r\nno one could predict how bad things might get. That was the backdrop to \r\nthe most difficult decision I have experienced on a company board: the \r\nvote to rebase the dividend. It was historic for Shell. More importantly, it \r\nwas human. This was about the people who invest in us, whose belief in \r\nShell is partly rewarded by the dividend. The grim reality was there \r\nwas\xa0only one thing worse than rebasing the dividend: not rebasing \r\nthe\xa0dividend.\r\nWe could have borrowed to keep the dividend at the same level. But in \r\nour view that would have been a mistake. By taking the decisive action to \r\nrebase the dividend significantly as we did, I believe we ensured that Shell \r\ncould emerge from the impact of COVID-19 in strong shape.\r\nIn October, we were able to raise the dividend by a modest amount, \r\nand\xa0signal our intention to have annual dividend increases, subject to \r\nBoard approval. The fundamentals remain intact. Despite the global \r\neconomic havoc wreaked by the pandemic, Shell continues to make \r\nstrategic progress.\r\nFINDING A WAY\r\nBen van Beurden, the Chief Executive Officer of Royal Dutch Shell, \r\ndeserves credit for this progress. Over the years, he has listened to those \r\nurging Shell to do more to help tackle climate change. He saw we could \r\ncreate new businesses serving new customers and new markets for \r\nlow-carbon energy products. And the more governments act on climate \r\nchange, the more successful these businesses can become, and the better \r\nit will be for the planet.\r\nWe are also making progress in other ways. We hope that in May, \r\nshareholders will agree to appoint a Board which, for the first time in \r\nShell’s history, will consist equally of men and women. Greater diversity \r\nbrings greater understanding of people, and better decision-making.\r\nShell has set challenging emissions targets. In 2020, we announced our \r\ntarget to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 in step \r\nwith society. We intend to meet our customers’ demand for cleaner \r\nenergy, keeping pace with society’s progress towards tackling climate \r\nchange. As this suggests, we cannot stand still. When necessary, we must \r\nbe as fast-moving as we were when the pandemic hit. We must also strive \r\nconstantly to increase productivity, to continue to build financial strength.\r\nIn the worst of times, you often see the best of people. In 2020, our \r\npeople showed great character in adversity. I thank every one of them. \r\nI\xa0firmly believe their efforts mean Shell will continue to succeed, to deliver \r\nenergy and to power progress.\r\nCHAD HOLLIDAY\r\nChair\r\nAdapting to the \r\nenergy transition\r\nWorking together across Shell \r\nduring the COVID-19 global pandemic\r\nBelow (clockwise from top left): Shell made innovative use of robots during lockdowns;\r\nour people kept service stations open; Krishna Gupta; Niki Jackson.\r\nShell can invest in areas where we will be \r\ncompetitive,\xa0such as hydrogen.\r\nStrategic Report\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/Shell plc/Shell plc_2020.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='6 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2020\r\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW\r\nPOWERING \r\nPROGRESS \r\nAND\xa0FACING \r\nA\xa0PANDEMIC\r\nIn 2020 we began implementing our new safety approach, which places \r\ngreater emphasis on increasing the chances of people emerging unhurt \r\neven if there is an incident. For the first year in our history, there were zero \r\nfatal accidents in Shell-operated facilities. I want this achievement to spur \r\nus on so that we keep working hard on safety. \r\nTHE GOALS OF POWERING PROGRESS \r\nWe worked towards refreshing our strategy in 2020, and in February \r\n2021, we announced Powering Progress. It is what I believe Shell does. \r\nIt\xa0is\xa0what I believe Shell should continue to do.\r\nOur Powering Progress strategy combines our ambitions under four goals: \r\ngenerating shareholder value, achieving net-zero emissions, powering \r\nlives and respecting nature. This will help us accelerate our progress \r\ntowards becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, \r\nin\xa0step\xa0with society.\r\nWe will lower emissions from our operations, including the energy consumed \r\nin running them, and help our customers to reduce their emissions from using \r\nour products. Importantly, this will include emissions from oil and gas that \r\nothers produce and we then sell in our products – an industry-leading \r\napproach.\r\nShell will deal with any of its remaining emissions using carbon capture and \r\nstorage (CCS) technology, or offsets where plants absorb carbon dioxide.\r\nWe expect our total oil production to reduce by 1-2% a year until 2030, \r\ntaking into account divestments and natural decline. But we expect \r\nUpstream oil and gas production to deliver strong cash flows into the \r\n2030s, underpinning our returns to shareholders and helping to fund the \r\nlow-carbon investments that will transform Shell’s energy mix. In all these \r\nways, Shell will change as the world adopts the low-carbon energy \r\nsystem needed to tackle climate change.\r\nWINNING IN A TRANSFORMED ENERGY SYSTEM\r\nCustomers and the choices they make will define the nature of the future \r\nenergy system.\r\nI think the winning energy companies will be those, like Shell, who are best \r\nplaced to serve customers.\r\nWe serve more than 1 million commercial and industrial customers, and \r\n30\xa0million customers at 46,000 retail service stations every day.\r\nWe have the leading market positions. We have strong starting positions \r\nin products and services that customers are going to want more and more: \r\nbiofuels, electric-vehicle charging networks, and hydrogen.\r\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic affected us all. Sadly, it claimed the \r\nlives of 20 of our Shell colleagues. I heard the stories behind these \r\ntragedies, and the cruelty of the pandemic really hit home.\r\nThe virus also wreaked havoc with the global economy, dramatically \r\nsuppressing energy demand. Our income went from $16.4 billion in 2019 \r\nto a loss of $21.5 billion in 2020, which included non-cash impairments of \r\n$28.1 billion. In April, with oil prices falling rapidly, Shell took swift, \r\ndecisive action to preserve cash and stay resilient. We rebased the \r\ndividend, lowering it by 66%.\r\nIt was a very difficult decision to make, but the right thing to do.\r\nOur dividend payments went from $15.2 billion in 2019 to $7.4 billion in \r\n2020. We combined rebasing the dividend with the discipline to reduce \r\ncash capital expenditure from $23.9 billion in 2019 to $17.8 billion in \r\n2020. We reduced net debt from $79.1 billion in 2019 to $75.4 billion \r\nat\xa0the end of 2020.\r\nIn October, with global energy demand looking more robust, we raised \r\nthe dividend by 4% and signalled our intention to have annual dividend \r\nincreases, subject to Board approval.\r\nOur industry-leading cash flows from operations confirm Shell’s underlying \r\nstrength. Despite the unprecedented challenges, we delivered cash flow \r\nfrom operating activities of $34.1 billion in 2020, compared with \r\n$42.2\xa0billion in 2019.\r\nOnce we have reduced net debt to $65 billion, we will target total \r\nshareholder distributions of 20-30% of cash flow from operations.\r\nBEN VAN BEURDEN \r\nChief Executive Officer \r\nStrategic Report\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/Shell plc/Shell plc_2020.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2020 7\r\nWe can work with our customers to develop the low-carbon markets of \r\nthe\xa0future. In this way, Shell would generate value for shareholders while \r\nworking towards its net-zero carbon emissions target. Society would \r\nbenefit from reduced emissions.\r\nTake the CrossWind consortium, a joint venture between Shell and Eneco \r\nthat in 2020 won the tender for the Hollandse Kust (noord) wind farm off \r\nthe\xa0Dutch coast. Shell’s plan is to use the wind farm’s renewable electricity \r\nfor\xa0powering the industrial-scale production of low-carbon hydrogen \r\nby\xa0electrolysis, a process that splits water into oxygen and hydrogen.\r\nWe will then work with hauliers and truck manufacturers to develop a \r\nmarket for hydrogen as a low-carbon fuel for heavy goods transport.\r\nTHE VALUE OF STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS\r\nHollandse Kust (noord) is helping Shell to form other important strategic \r\nrelationships. In February 2021, Amazon signed an agreement to buy \r\nrenewable electricity from the wind farm.\r\nThrough its air cargo fleet, Amazon also has a growing interest in aviation, \r\none of those sectors that will be hard to decarbonise. Shell has one of the \r\nworld’s most extensive aircraft refuelling networks. We can work with \r\ncustomers, suppliers and regulators to develop a commercially viable and \r\nprofitable market for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). We have agreed to \r\nsupply Amazon with up to six million gallons of blended SAF for its cargo \r\naircraft. This biofuel, produced by the company World Energy using \r\nagricultural waste fats and oils, has lower life-cycle carbon emissions \r\nthan\xa0conventional jet fuel.\r\nWe also formed a strategic alliance with Microsoft in 2020. Shell is \r\nsupplying Microsoft with renewable energy, supporting it towards its \r\ngoal\xa0of using 100% renewable energy by 2025. Both businesses will \r\ndevelop digital tools to help Shell’s customers decarbonise.\r\nWe are working on more of these strategic relationships, generating \r\nvalue\xa0while helping sectors to reduce their carbon emissions.\r\nIn 2020 we announced a major reorganisation which will take effect from \r\nAugust 2021. We believe this will make us more responsive to customers, \r\nas a nimbler organisation with lower costs.\r\nWe expect to reduce between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs as we make these \r\nchanges. It will mean saying goodbye to many people who have shown \r\nus great loyalty. We will do this in the spirit of our core values of honesty, \r\nintegrity and respect for people.\r\nAs we prepare for the years ahead, we can draw confidence from how \r\nwe\xa0rose to the challenges of 2020.\r\nWhat struck me was how our people combined ingenuity with \r\ndetermination to do the right thing: in applying financial discipline, in \r\nsupplying energy during lockdowns, in making donations to help their \r\ncommunities fight COVID-19. In such hard times, our people generated \r\nvalue for society, and Shell.\r\nThey fill me with confidence for the future. With a strong strategy and \r\ngood people, Shell will power progress for decades to come.\r\nBEN VAN BEURDEN \r\nChief Executive Officer \r\nPowering Progress \r\nThe Powering Progress strategy combines our ambitions under four goals \r\n(from top): generating shareholder value; achieving net-zero emissions; \r\npowering lives; and respecting nature.\r\nStrategic Report\n', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Capstone/Company Reports/Shell plc/Shell plc_2020.pdf', 'page': 10})]","Summarize Shell's 2020 performance and future plans based on the CEO's letter.
