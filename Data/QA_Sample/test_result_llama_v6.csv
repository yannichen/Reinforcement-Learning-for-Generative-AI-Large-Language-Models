The group also uses management information to monitor credit risk, which reflects the impact of credit enhancements. Additionally, the group recognizes expected credit loss allowances on financial assets based on historical experience and relevant market and academic research, and applies credit enhancements to mitigate credit risk. The maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount, and the group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses."," The group's experience of credit risk is used to determine the appropriate level of impairment allowances for financial assets. The group's historical actual credit loss experience is compared with the expected credit loss provision to determine the necessary allowances. The group's underwriting and risk modeling experience is also considered while reviewing credit risk. The purpose of the review is to determine the group's expected credit loss allowances for financial assets, which are a key indicator of the group's overall credit risk profile."

The Paris goals 
(1) Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement states the goal of ‘Holding the 
increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above 
pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this 
would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change’.
(2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: In order to achieve the long-term 
temperature goal set out in Article 2, parties aim to reach global 
peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, 
recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country 
parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance 
with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between 
anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of 
greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of 
equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to 
eradicate poverty.

Appointment and time 
commitment
The chairman, senior independent director  
and other NEDs each have letters of appointment 
and do not serve, nor are they employed, in any 
executive capacity. There is no fixed term limit  
on a director’s service; however, in line with good 
governance practice, bp proposes all directors  
for annual re-election by shareholders.Unlike the chairman’s letter of appointment, the 
NEDs’ letters of appointment do not set a fixed 
time commitment. NEDs are expected to allocate 
appropriate time to effectively discharge their 
duties. The time required of NEDs fluctuates 
depending on the demands of bp business and 
other events. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well  
as the oversight by the board of the energy 
transition and associated workload, required  
the NEDs to spend considerably more time 
fulfilling their responsibilities towards bp during 
2020, than in previous years. This included  
NEDs dedicating additional time through regular 
calls with the leadership team to remain informed 
and help guide the executive through 
unprecedented times. 
The NEDs’ external time commitments are 
regularly reviewed, ensuring that, even in the 
exceptional circumstances of a global pandemic, 
the NEDs are able to allocate appropriate time  
to bp. The review process is managed by the 
company secretary, considering NEDs’ outside 
appointments and commitments, including 
relevant factors such as complexity of company 
and industry, in particular highly regulated 
sectors, and issues impacting these other 
companies. The board has concluded that, 
notwithstanding the NEDs’ other appointments, 
they are each able to dedicate sufficient time  
to fulfil their bp duties.

23,How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect the time commitment of Non-Executive Directors at bp?,"satisfied itself that there were no matters  
giving rise to any conflict of interests or which 
compromised the independence of the NEDs.  
It has therefore concluded that all bp NEDs  
are independent.
Professor Dame Ann Dowling continues to serve 
on the board notwithstanding that she has served 
beyond nine years as a NED. Following careful 
consideration, the board believes that Ann 
continues to provide constructive challenge and 
robust scrutiny of matters that come before the 
board and the committee on which she serves. 
She has only served with the current executive 
directors for a year and the overall average tenure 
of the board is below the FTSE 100 average. In 
addition, in 2018 the board undertook significant 
refreshment of its composition. Accordingly,  
the board is satisfied that Ann continues to 
demonstrate the qualities of independence  
in carrying out her duties.
Appointment and time 
commitment
The chairman, senior independent director  
and other NEDs each have letters of appointment 
and do not serve, nor are they employed, in any 
executive capacity. There is no fixed term limit  
on a director’s service; however, in line with good 
governance practice, bp proposes all directors  
for annual re-election by shareholders.Unlike the chairman’s letter of appointment, the 
NEDs’ letters of appointment do not set a fixed 
time commitment. NEDs are expected to allocate 
appropriate time to effectively discharge their 
duties. The time required of NEDs fluctuates 
depending on the demands of bp business and 
other events. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well  
as the oversight by the board of the energy 
transition and associated workload, required  
the NEDs to spend considerably more time 
fulfilling their responsibilities towards bp during 
2020, than in previous years. This included  
NEDs dedicating additional time through regular 
calls with the leadership team to remain informed 
and help guide the executive through 
unprecedented times. 
The NEDs’ external time commitments are 
regularly reviewed, ensuring that, even in the 
exceptional circumstances of a global pandemic, 
the NEDs are able to allocate appropriate time  
to bp. The review process is managed by the 
company secretary, considering NEDs’ outside 
appointments and commitments, including 
relevant factors such as complexity of company 
and industry, in particular highly regulated 
sectors, and issues impacting these other 
companies. The board has concluded that, 
notwithstanding the NEDs’ other appointments, 
they are each able to dedicate sufficient time  
to fulfil their bp duties. 
Executive directors are normally permitted to  
take up one board appointment at an external 
company, subject to the agreement of the 
chairman and after consultation with the 
company secretary. Bernard Looney and Murray 
Auchincloss each hold one non-executive 
directorship, shown on page 74. Prior to retiring 
from the board in June 2020, Brian Gilvary",The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased the time commitment of Non-Executive Directors at bp. They had to spend considerably more time fulfilling their responsibilities towards bp in 2020 compared to previous years.

The remuneration committee always seeks to align employee reward with shareholder experience. As the world faced unprecedented challenges and bp faced extraordinary measures to maintain safe operations, the NEDs had to dedicate additional time to ensure the interests of shareholders were protected. The pandemic also highlighted the importance of strong governance and disclosure of material information, which is a key aspect of the remuneration committee's role. Despite the challenges, bp's board remained committed to good governance and ensured timely disclosure of material information. The NEDs played a crucial role in navigating bp through the pandemic and maintaining strong governance practices."

•The EU Fuel Quality Directive affects our production and marketing of 
transport fuels including mandating reductions in the life cycle GHG 
emissions per unit of energy and tighter environmental fuel quality 
standards for petrol and diesel. 
•Germany is expected to launch a national emissions trading system in 
2021 for transport and heating fuels. Impacted fuel suppliers in 
Germany will pay a fixed price for emissions certificates of EUR 25 per 
tonne CO2 in 2021 rising to EUR 55 per tonne by 2025. In 2026, 
emissions certificates will be auctioned but with prices limited between 
EUR 55 and EUR 65 per tonne CO2 emitted.  A review of the system is 
expected to take place in 2025 to determine the position beyond 2026.

•In December 2020 the UK Government announced a targeted reduction 
in the UK’s GHG emissions of at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 
levels. The UK also announced an emissions trading system from 1 January 2021 onwards which would include the same installations in 
the UK that were previously subject to the EU ETS.
•China is operating emission trading pilot programmes in five cities and 
three provinces. One of bp's subsidiaries « and one of bp’s joint 
venture« companies in China are participating in these schemes. China 
launched its national emissions trading market (National ETS), initially

2020, China promulgated the national regulation on National ETS which 
became effective on 1 February 2021, when the National ETS was 
officially launched . 
•China has also adopted more stringent vehicle tailpipe emission 
standards and vehicle efficiency standards to address air pollution and 
GHG emissions. These standards will have an impact on transportation 
fuel product mix and overall demand. In addition, China has also 
introduced a mandate for sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) 
commencing in 2020. This has been accelerating NEV penetration into 
the light vehicle sector and impact light fuel demand.

Aramco satisfies certain conditions commensurate with current operating practices (and may be amended and extended for an additional 40 years thereafter subject to Aramco and the Government agreeing on the terms of 
the extension), there is no assurance 
that the Government will not revoke 
the Concession in whole or in part or 
adversely change Aramco’s rights in respect of the Concession, which would have a significant effect on Aramco’s business, financial position and results 
of operations. Furthermore, if the 
Kingdom were to take additional actions under its regulatory powers or change laws, regulations, policies or practices relating to the oil and gas industry, Aramco’s business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Moreover, exports of crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals by Aramco or its affiliates to foreign countries may be affected by litigation, regulatory actions, 
investigations, disputes or agreements 
that lead to the imposition of  import trade 
measures, including anti-dumping and 
countervailing duties, safeguard measures, import licensing and customs requirements, and new or increased tariffs, quotas or embargos. The possibility and effect of any such measures will depend on the laws governing the foreign country to which the applicable products are being 
exported and applicable international 
trade agreements. Foreign countries may take such measures for political or other reasons, including reasons unrelated 
to Aramco’s actions or operations. Since 
the majority of Aramco’s products are exported, any such measures may have 
a material adverse effect on Aramco’s 
business, financial position and results 
of operations.
In addition, the Kingdom is a party to international trade agreements, such as World Trade Organization agreements that include commitments by the Kingdom with respect to the composition of its laws, regulations and practices 
that impact international trade. The 
Kingdom may become a party to 
other  such agreements in the future. 
Compliance by the Kingdom with any such commitments may directly or indirectly impact Aramco and could 
cause  it to alter its operations in a manner 
that is costly or otherwise has a  material 
adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations. If the Kingdom fails to comply with these commitments, Aramco’s business operations could be exposed to scrutiny and Aramco or its affiliates’ exports 
could  be subject to potential remedial 
measures, such as duties, which could have a material adverse effect on Aramco’s business, financial position 
and results of operations.Violations of applicable 
sanctions  and trade restrictions, 
as well as anti-bribery and anti-
corruption laws, could adversely 
affect Aramco.
Aramco currently conducts business, 
and could in the future decide to take 
part in new business activities, in locations","There is no assurance that the Government will not revoke the Concession in whole or in part or adversely change Aramco's rights, which would have a significant effect on Aramco's business, financial position, and results of operations. Additionally, if the Kingdom takes additional regulatory actions or changes laws and policies related to the oil and gas industry, it could materially and adversely affect Aramco's operations.",Saudi Aramco_2020," Based on the provided context, there are several potential risks to Aramco's business, financial position, and results of operations due to the revocation of the Concession by the Government. These include:

1. Loss of revenue: If the Concession is revoked, Aramco may lose its rights to operate in the Kingdom and generate revenue from its downstream operations.
2. Disruption of business operations: The revocation of the Concession could disrupt Aramco's business operations, including its ability to produce and sell hydrocarbons, which could impact its financial position and results of operations.
3. Increased costs: Aramco may incur unanticipated costs or assume unexpected liabilities and losses in connection with any business or asset it acquires, including in relation to the retention of key employees, legal contingencies, and risks related to the acquired business.
4. Difficulty in integrating acquired businesses: Aramco may face challenges in effectively integrating the purchased businesses or assets, which could impact its financial position and results of operations.
5. Adverse changes in economic and trade sanctions: The revocation of the Concession could lead to adverse changes in economic and trade sanctions, which could impact Aramco's ability to operate in the Kingdom and generate revenue.
6. Loss of value of assets: If the Concession is revoked, the value of Aramco's assets may decrease, which could impact its financial position and results of operations.
7. Difficulty in maintaining and integrating procedures, controls, and quality standards: Aramco may face challenges in maintaining and integrating procedures, controls, and quality standards in connection with any business or asset it acquires, which could impact its financial position and results of operations.

Overall, the revocation of the Concession by the Government could have a material adverse effect on Aramco's business, financial position, and results of operations."," The potential risks to Aramco's business, financial position, and results of operations due to the revocation of the Concession by the Government include: loss of rights, interests, and benefits under the Concession; potential financial liabilities and losses; loss of revenue, income, and business; and other unforeseen consequences.

These measures could have a material adverse effect on Aramco's business, as they may lead to increased costs, reduced market access, and disrupted trade relationships with foreign countries.",Saudi Aramco_2020," Sure! Here are some examples of potential import trade measures that could affect Aramco's exports and have a material adverse effect on its business:

1. Anti-dumping and countervailing duties: These measures are designed to protect domestic industries from what is perceived to be unfair competition from foreign producers. If Aramco is found to be selling its products at below market value or receiving unfair government subsidies, it could be subject to duties that increase the cost of its exports and reduce its competitiveness.
2. Safeguard measures: These measures are implemented to protect domestic industries from sudden increases in imports that are deemed to be a threat to national security or domestic industries. If Aramco's exports are deemed to be a threat to national security or domestic industries, it could be subject to safeguard measures that limit its exports or increase the cost of its exports.
3. Import licensing and customs requirements: Governments may impose licensing requirements or customs requirements that make it more difficult or expensive for Aramco to export its products. For example, a government may require Aramco to obtain a license to export a particular product or impose additional customs duties on its exports.
4. New or increased tariffs, quotas, or embargos: Governments may impose new or increased tariffs, quotas, or embargos on Aramco's exports. These measures could increase the cost of Aramco's exports or reduce the quantity of its exports, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.
5. Investigations or other trade actions: If Aramco is subject to investigations or other trade actions, it could face potential penalties or remedial measures, such as duties, that could have a material adverse effect on its business.
6. Export restrictions: Governments may impose restrictions on the export of certain products, such as petrochemicals, which could affect Aramco's ability to export these products and have a material adverse effect on its business.
7. Trade agreements: If the Kingdom enters into new trade agreements that are less favorable to Aramco, it could have a material adverse effect on its business. For example, if the Kingdom enters into an agreement that reduces or eliminates tariffs on Aramco's exports, but also imposes new requirements or restrictions on its exports, it could have a material adverse effect on its business.
8. Environmental claims: If Aramco is subject to environmental claims or lawsuits, it could have a material adverse effect on its business. For example, if it is found to be responsible for environmental damage, it could face significant fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on its business.

These are just a few examples of potential import trade measures that could affect Aramco's exports and have a material adverse effect on its business. The specific measures that could be taken will depend on the laws and regulations of the relevant countries and international trade agreements."," Certainly! Aramco could be subject to various import trade measures, including anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties, safeguard measures, import licensing requirements, and new or increased tariffs, quotas, or embargos. Examples of such measures include:

* Anti-dumping duties on imports of steel, aluminum, or other products into the U.S. could significantly reduce the volume of U.S. exports to countries with which the U.S. has a significant trade deficit, such as China, Korea, and Japan. This could have a material adverse effect on U.S. exports and the overall U.S. trade balance.
* Countervailing duties on imports of goods, including steel, aluminum, and other products, could also significantly reduce the volume of U.S. exports to countries with which the U.S. has a significant trade deficit, as well as U.S. exports of goods to countries that have signed free trade agreements with the U.S. or are otherwise committed to trade liberalization.
* Failure by the Kingdom to comply with its commitments under the WTO Agreement or other international trade agreements, including non-market-access agreements, could result in the imposition of retaliatory measures by the U.S. or other WTO Members. This could have a material adverse effect on U.S. exports and the overall U.S. trade balance.

changing environment, there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability around the extent to which the COVID-19 
pandemic will impact our future results, which could be material. 
Chevron entered this crisis well positioned with a strong balance sheet, flexible capital program and low cash flow breakeven 
price. To protect its long-term health and value, the company took swift action, adjusting the items it can control. The 
company lowered its capital expenditures 35 percent and lowered its operating expense, excluding non-recurring severance 
costs, by $1.4 billion compared to 2019. The company completed an enterprise-wide transformation that is expected to 
capture additional cost efficiencies. Additionally, the company suspended its stock repurchase program in March 2020. 
Taken together, these actions are consistent with our financial priorities: to protect the dividend, to prioritize capital spend 
that drives long-term value, and to maintain a strong balance sheet. The company expects to continue to have sufficient 
liquidity and access to both commercial paper and debt capital markets due to its strong balance sheet and investment grade 
credit ratings. Additionally, the company has access to nearly $10 billion in committed credit facilities. 
The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due 
to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower 
tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of 
expected results in future periods. Note 15 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years. 
Refer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” in Part I, 
Item 1A, on pages 18 through 23 of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the inherent 
risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. 
The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term 
value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial 
performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future 
periods. The company’s asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 targeted before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. For the 
three year period ending December 31, 2020, assets sales proceeds totaled $7.7 billion, in the middle of the guidance range.","To protect its long-term health and value, Chevron took swift action during the COVID-19 crisis.

Lastly, Chevron strives to maintain a strong balance sheet, emphasizing financial stability and flexibility. These financial priorities reflect Chevron's commitment to delivering long-term value for its stakeholders and navigating through various market conditions.",Chevron_2020," Based on the information provided in the annual report, Chevron's financial priorities in terms of dividend, capital spend, and balance sheet are as follows:

Dividend: Chevron has a long history of paying a consistent and competitive dividend to its shareholders. In 2020, the company paid $5.16 per share in cash dividends, which represents a dividend payout ratio of 60.6% of net income.

Capital Spend: Chevron's capital expenditures in 2020 were $5.13 billion, which is lower than the previous year's expenditures of $8.19 billion. The company's capital expenditures are focused on maintaining and expanding its existing operations, as well as investing in new projects that will drive long-term growth.

Balance Sheet: Chevron's total assets at the end of 2020 were $239.8 billion, with total liabilities of $107.1 billion and total equity of $132.7 billion. The company's debt ratio was 25.2%, which is considered reasonable given the company's size and business mix. Chevron also had $17.8 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of 2020, which provides a significant buffer against potential future capital expenditures or unforeseen events.

Overall, Chevron's financial priorities appear to be focused on maintaining a consistent and competitive dividend, investing in growth projects while keeping debt levels reasonable, and maintaining a strong balance sheet."," Chevron's financial priorities are to maintain a strong balance sheet, focus on dividend payments, and allocate capital for long-term growth. The company aims to achieve a balance between these priorities while also addressing near-term cash flow needs and shareholder value creation. In terms of capital spend, Chevron focuses on investments in the Upstream segment to drive downstream margins, downstream deepening projects, and investments in downstream infrastructure. Additionally, the company prioritizes downstream expansion projects, including the construction of a new 1.2 million barrels/day refinery in Corpus Christi and expansions in Baytown and Beaumont. In terms of balance sheet, Chevron focuses on managing debt, maintaining strong credit ratings, and optimizing working capital. The company also prioritizes shareholder value creation through the delivery of cash flow to shareholders and the return of capital to shareholders. Overall, Chevron's key financial priorities are to balance sheet strength, dividend payments, and allocation of capital for long-term growth.

The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on
the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month timeperiod long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous tothe end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.

As of December 31, 2020, the pension obligation was approximately $6.2 billion. This amount includes a $4.0 billion reduction in fair value of plan assets. The company used a discount rate of 2.4 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of the plan.

Year ended December 31
2020 2019 2018",Total financing interest and debt costs in 2018 amounted to $921 million.,Chevron_2020," Based on the given information, the total financing interest and debt costs in 2018 can be calculated as follows:

Total long-term debt at December 31, 2018 was $23,691, and the weighted-average interest rate for long-term debt was 1.69%. Therefore, the total financing interest expense for 2018 can be calculated as follows:

Financing interest expense = Total long-term debt x Weighted-average interest rate
= $23,691 x 1.69%
= $387

Additionally, the total debt costs for 2018 can be calculated as follows:

Debt costs = Total long-term debt x Average interest rate
= $23,691 x 1.69%
= $387

Therefore, the total financing interest and debt costs for 2018 were $387.

Note: This answer assumes that the interest rate remains constant throughout the year, which may not be the case in reality. Also, this answer does not take into account any other debt-related costs, such as issuance costs or fees."," The total financing interest and debt costs in 2018 were $11,690 million of debt issuance costs and $11,373 million of financing interest.

Note: The total financing interest and debt costs in 2018 were recorded as deferred financing costs and were subsequently amortized over a period of one year to three years, depending on the availability of long-term financing. The company may enter into interest rate swaps or other financial agreements to manage its interest rate risk profile. These agreements, along with other factors, may impact the availability and cost of financing for the company.

change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past
operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable
and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an AROis made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 23, onpage 94, for a discussion of the company’s AROs.
For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of
the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by theregulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmentalliabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying currentregulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies.

Revenue is measured based on consideration expected to be received in exchange for the product, net of any discounts or allowances.",Chevron_2020," Chevron Corporation accounts for revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company recognizes revenue when it is earned, which is typically when the product is delivered or services are rendered. Chevron uses various methods to determine when revenue is earned, including the percentage-of-completion method, the cost-recovery method, and the completed-contract method. The company also considers factors such as the progress of the project, the stage of completion, and the amount of work completed to determine when revenue is earned.

Unhelpful Answer: I'm not sure how Chevron Corporation accounts for revenue recognition. I don't have access to their financial statements or internal policies."," Chevron Corporation uses the modified retrospective transition approach, under which all unrecognized revenue from prior periods is initially recorded as revenue and subsequently adjusted to fair value. This approach is consistent with the company’s accounting policies and practices, which are designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the financial statements are fair statements. Chevron’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements. The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures for accounting for transactions, including those related to significant transactions, such as acquisitions and dispositions, and the timing and sequence of events in financial statements. Chevron’s internal control over financial reporting also involves the use of reasonable judgment and estimates in the preparation of financial statements. The company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining the system of internal control over financial reporting. Chevron’s board of directors, including the lead director, are also involved in the oversight of the system of internal control. The goal is to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the financial statements are fair statements, with no material misstatements or inaccuracies in the financial statements. Chevron’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements. The company’s internal control over financial reporting is subject to ongoing review and revision, with the goal of maintaining a system of internal control that is reasonably effective in identifying, reporting, and managing risks.

In 2020, the company tested its goodwill for impairment and determined that no impairment was required. The goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 was $4,402, all of which is in the upstream segment and primarily related to the 2005 acquisition of Unocal. The company's goodwill impairment testing is performed using the income approach, which is a method that measures the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. The determination of whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals, and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company's business plans and long-term investment decisions."," Chevron Corporation did not record any significant impairment charges for goodwill in 2020.

For Chevron, it helps measure its ability to generate cash flow and assess its financial health. In 2020, Chevron had a free cash flow of $1,655 million.",Chevron_2020," Free cash flow is a financial metric that measures the amount of cash generated by a company's operations after subtracting capital expenditures. It represents the cash available to creditors and investors after investing in the business. A positive free cash flow indicates that a company is generating more cash than it is spending on capital expenditures, which can be used for investment, dividend payments, or debt repayment. For Chevron, free cash flow is significant as it can be used to fund its growth initiatives, pay dividends to shareholders, and reduce debt. A strong free cash flow position can also provide flexibility and options for the company's capital allocation."," Free cash flow is the cash provided by operating activities, including cash from divestitures, after investing in the business, and cash from financing activities, including debt issuances and borrowings, and cash from asset sales and returns of investments. It is a key indicator of the company’s ability to generate cash to invest in the business, fund acquisitions, and return value to shareholders. Free cash flow also helps to evaluate the company’s leverage and its ability to fund future capital projects and shareholder distributions. The significance of free cash flow for Chevron is that it provides the cash needed to invest in the business, financing acquisitions, and returning value to shareholders. In 2020, Chevron reported a significant decrease in free cash flow compared to 2019 due to increased capital expenditures, including investments in the Permian Basin, Midstream Investments, and the Gulf of Mexico. Despite challenges such as low oil and gas prices, production declines, and increased competition, Chevron reported a net decrease of 3,413 million dollars of free cash flow in 2020, compared to a net decrease of 4,479 million dollars in 2019. This information is important for evaluating the company’s financial health and its ability to generate cash to invest in the business, financing acquisitions, and returning value to shareholders."

Additionally, the text states that all active counterparties are subject to regular reviews, including re-appraisal and approval of granted limits. However, it is not clear how frequently these reviews are conducted or what specific factors are taken into account during the review process."," The process involves a thorough evaluation of the counterparty's financial standing and business risks.

These variations do not include any non-cash changes, such as changes in the fair value of financial instruments or the effects of interest rate and foreign currency swaps. To determine the non-cash changes, you would need to analyze the financial statements further, taking into account the relevant accounting standards and policies."," Non-cash changes in financial debt were primarily due to the application of accounting changes related to the classification of certain financial instruments as liabilities, including pension funding and deferred compensation plans. These changes were implemented in 2018 and were not present in 2017. The application of these accounting changes resulted in a higher net amount of non-current financial debt in 2020 compared to 2017. Additionally, in 2017, non-cash changes in financial debt were primarily due to the issuance of new financial instruments, including debt offerings and bond issuances, and the repayment of financial instruments.

exposed to risks that, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, reputation, outlook, or the price of financial instruments issued by TOTAL. 
This section presents the significant risk factors specific to the Group,  
to whi
ch it believes it is exposed as of the filing date of the Universal 
Registration Document. However, the Group may be exposed to other 
non-specific risks, or risks of which it may not be aware, or risks of which it may be underestimating the potential consequences, or other risks that may not have been considered by the Group as being likely to have a material adverse impact on the Group, its business, financial condition, reputation or outlook. 
In particular, it could be exposed to systemic risks, such as unexpected 
major di
sruptions (health such as the COVID-19 pandemic, security, 
monetary or cyber), leading to large-scale disruptions with global human and economic repercussions.
In such a context, the management of the COVID-19 health crisis

erated by a Group entity or nearby is one of the most closely 
monitored risks in view of the potential consequences. New facility construction projects comply with international technical standards from the design stage in order to limit exposure. For production sites operated by a Group entity and subject to this risk, the One MAESTRO reference framework sets out the prevention process in several stages. First, hazardous products such as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMR) chemicals are listed and their risks identified. Second, potential exposure to levels that may present a risk to the health of personnel, contractors or local residents at the site or nearby are identified and assessed, and prevention or attenuation measures are implemented in order to control the risk. Lastly, the approach is checked (atmospheric checks, specific medical monitoring, audits etc.) in order to verify its effectiveness and implement improvement measures if necessary. This is also set out formally in a risk assessment file, which is revised regularly by the Subsidiary.
Limiting the environmental footprint of the Group’s sites
TOTAL implements a policy of avoiding, reducing, managing and monitoring the environmental footprint of its operations. As part of  this policy, emissions are identified and quantified by environment  (water, air and soil) so that appropriate measures can be taken to better control them.
Water, air
The Group’s operations generate discharges such as smokes from combustion plants, emissions into the air from the various conversion processes and discharges of wastewater. In addition to complying with applicable legislation, TOTAL has drawn up rules and guidelines that the Group’s Subsidiaries can use to limit the quantities discharged. TOTAL has set itself targets for reducing sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions and is 
committed to limiting its hydrocarbon discharges into water. After analysis, the exposed sites can introduce various reduction systems that include organizational measures (such as using predictive models to control peaks in sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions based on weather forecast 
data and the improvement of combustion process management, etc.) and technical measures (wastewater treatment plants, using low NO
X 
burners and electrostatic scrubbers, etc.). To date, all refineries wholly owned by the Group have this type of system.
For new facilities developed by the Group, the internal rules require 
impact a
ssessments to be carried out and, if necessary, actions must  
be taken to limit the impact of these emissions.
Soil

from accidental spills and waste storage. TOTAL has drawn up a guide that the Subsidiaries can use to prevent and contain this pollution.

28,How does TOTAL prevent leaks and contain soil pollution?,"at a site op
erated by a Group entity or nearby is one of the most closely 
monitored risks in view of the potential consequences. New facility construction projects comply with international technical standards from the design stage in order to limit exposure. For production sites operated by a Group entity and subject to this risk, the One MAESTRO reference framework sets out the prevention process in several stages. First, hazardous products such as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMR) chemicals are listed and their risks identified. Second, potential exposure to levels that may present a risk to the health of personnel, contractors or local residents at the site or nearby are identified and assessed, and prevention or attenuation measures are implemented in order to control the risk. Lastly, the approach is checked (atmospheric checks, specific medical monitoring, audits etc.) in order to verify its effectiveness and implement improvement measures if necessary. This is also set out formally in a risk assessment file, which is revised regularly by the Subsidiary.
Limiting the environmental footprint of the Group’s sites
TOTAL implements a policy of avoiding, reducing, managing and monitoring the environmental footprint of its operations. As part of  this policy, emissions are identified and quantified by environment  (water, air and soil) so that appropriate measures can be taken to better control them.
Water, air
The Group’s operations generate discharges such as smokes from combustion plants, emissions into the air from the various conversion processes and discharges of wastewater. In addition to complying with applicable legislation, TOTAL has drawn up rules and guidelines that the Group’s Subsidiaries can use to limit the quantities discharged. TOTAL has set itself targets for reducing sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions and is 
committed to limiting its hydrocarbon discharges into water. After analysis, the exposed sites can introduce various reduction systems that include organizational measures (such as using predictive models to control peaks in sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions based on weather forecast 
data and the improvement of combustion process management, etc.) and technical measures (wastewater treatment plants, using low NO
X 
burners and electrostatic scrubbers, etc.). To date, all refineries wholly owned by the Group have this type of system.
For new facilities developed by the Group, the internal rules require 
impact a
ssessments to be carried out and, if necessary, actions must  
be taken to limit the impact of these emissions.
Soil
The risks of soil pollution related to TOTAL ’s operations come mainly   
from accidental spills and waste storage. TOTAL has drawn up a guide that the Subsidiaries can use to prevent and contain this pollution.  
The recommended approach is based on four pillars:– preventing leaks, by implementing, as far as possible, industry best practice",TOTAL follows a guide that recommends implementing industry best practices to prevent leaks and contain soil pollution.,TotalEnergies_2020," TOTAL has a guide that the subsidiaries can use to prevent and contain soil pollution.

Changes in the Group’s headcount
The number of employees fell by 2.1% (2,300 employees) between 2019 
to 2020. This decrease is mainly due to the adequate management of recruitments. In 2020, 9,354 employees were hired on a permanent contract within the consolidated scope, a decrease of 36% compared to 2019. Indeed, in view of the global economic crisis in 2020, TOTAL chose to capitalize on its existing strengths in order to weather the storm. To maintain cost discipline — a pillar of its efforts to respond to the crisis — the Group largely narrowed its hiring; industries that are driving the Group’s transformation, such as new energies and digital technology, keeping more to secure TOTAL ’s future. In particular, TOTAL hires experienced candidates for positions requiring key skills, offering them long-term career prospects within the Group.
The variations in the breakdown by region and by business segment are 
mainly du
e to changes in the consolidated scope with the exit of some 
SunPower subsidiaries (more than 5,000 employees mainly in Mexico and Asia-Pacific) and the entry of a Marketing & Services subsidiary in Saudi Arabia and a German subsidiary in Refining & Chemicals, representing more than 3,500 employees.

To maintain cost discipline and respond to the crisis, the company narrowed its hiring and focused on industries driving its transformation, such as new energies and digital technology. Additionally, the company experienced changes in the consolidated scope with the exit of some subsidiaries and the entry of new subsidiaries, affecting the overall headcount.",TotalEnergies_2020," Based on the information provided in the passage, the main factors that influenced the decrease in the number of employees in 2020 were:

1. Adequate management of recruitments: The passage states that the Group chose to capitalize on its existing strengths in order to weather the storm caused by the global economic crisis in 2020, which led to a decrease in the number of employees hired.
2. Cost discipline: The passage highlights that the Group maintained cost discipline in 2020, which contributed to the decrease in the number of employees.
3. Focus on hiring experienced candidates: The passage notes that the Group hired experienced candidates for positions requiring key skills, offering them long-term career prospects within the Group, which may have resulted in a decrease in the number of new hires.

Unhelpful Answer:

1. The pandemic caused a decrease in the number of employees in 2020.
2. The Group experienced a sharp decline in business in 2020, leading to a decrease in the number of employees.
3. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the main factors that influenced the decrease in the number of employees in 2020."," The main factors that influenced the decrease in the number of employees in 2020 were adequate management of recruitments and the Group's ability to adapt to the global economic crisis. TOTAL chose to capitalize on its existing strengths to weather the storm, and as a result, the number of employees decreased significantly compared to 2019. The Group also prioritized hiring experienced candidates to secure the Group's transformation and future success."

5,What is the potential impact of the Tenth Circuit's decision on the EPA's reallocation of volumes exempted in 2020?,"has proposed to reallocate to non-exempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners 
that were granted a small refinery exemption. Also, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a small 
refinery is eligible for an exemption from the RFS only if it is applying for an extension of its original 
exemption. According to the EPA’s data, seven refineries were granted the small refinery exemption in 
2015. The United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in the 10th Circuit case. If the 10th Circuit 
decision is upheld, EPA’s reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 
2020. The reallocation of volumes under the 2020 rule or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions 
granted to us or other refiners could result in a decrease in the RIN bank, an increase in the price of RINs or 
an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend, any of which could increase MPC’s 
RFS cost of compliance. Further, the EPA has failed to promulgate timely the annual renewable fuel 
standards for 2021.
The RFS is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure 
constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline (“E10”). Since 
2016, the volume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the E10 
blendwall, which will require obligated parties to either sell E15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed 
historical levels or retire carryover RINs.
There is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of the RINs sold on the open market. We 
have developed a RIN integrity program to vet the RINs that we purchase, and we incur costs to audit RIN 
generators. Nevertheless, if any of the RINs that we purchase and use for compliance are found to be 
invalid, we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid RINs.
14In addition to the federal Renewable Fuel Standards, certain states have, or are considering, promulgation 
of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards. For example, California began implementing its Low 
Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) in January 2011. In September 2015, the CARB approved the re-adoption 
of the LCFS, which became effective on January 1, 2016, to address procedural deficiencies in the way the 
original regulation was adopted. The LCFS was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 
20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030. We incur costs to comply with 
the California LCFS, and these costs may increase if the cost of LCFS credits increases.
In sum, the RFS has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or 
expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. We may experience a decrease in demand 
for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced","If the Tenth Circuit decision is upheld, the EPA's reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 2020.

This is because if obligated parties like ExxonMobil are required to blend more renewable fuel to make up for the exempted volumes or the exemptions are invalidated, there will be higher demand for RINs, driving up the price and potentially depleting the RIN bank reserves.",Marathon Petroleum Corporation_2020," The reallocation of volumes or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions could potentially impact the RIN bank and the price of RINs in several ways:

1. Increased demand: If the reallocation of volumes results in an increase in demand for RINs, it could lead to higher prices. This is because the RIN market is a supply-and-demand market, and if demand increases without a corresponding increase in supply, prices will likely rise.
2. Reduced supply: If past small refinery exemptions are invalidated, it could result in a reduction in the supply of RINs available for purchase. This could lead to higher prices as well, as the reduced supply would put upward pressure on prices.
3. Changes in market dynamics: The reallocation of volumes or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions could also lead to changes in market dynamics, such as shifts in the balance of power between buyers and sellers or changes in the way RINs are traded. These changes could impact the price of RINs and the overall stability of the RIN market.

It's important to note that the impact of these events on the RIN market would depend on various factors, including the scale of the reallocation or invalidation, the duration of the event, and the overall state of the RIN market at the time. Additionally, the RIN market is subject to various other factors that could impact prices, such as changes in global demand for transportation fuels, geopolitical events, and regulatory developments.", We expect the reallocation of volumes and the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions to have a negative impact on our RIN bank and the price of RINs.

This means that obligated parties will either need to sell higher ethanol blends like E15 or flex fuels or retire carryover RINs, as blending higher ethanol concentrations poses challenges for vehicles, regulations, and infrastructure.",Marathon Petroleum Corporation_2020," The constraints that limit the blending of more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline are primarily vehicle, regulatory, and infrastructure constraints. For example, most vehicles are not designed to run on higher than 10 percent ethanol blends, and there may be limited infrastructure to support the distribution and sale of higher blends.

Unhelpful Answer: I'm not sure. I don't have access to the specific information about the constraints that limit ethanol blending.

Please answer the question based on the given context."," The EPA has finalized the annual renewable fuel standards for 2020. The volume requirements for 2020 were reduced from the 2019 volumes due to statutory and regulatory constraints, including the blendwall. The blendwall is a statutory limit on the volume of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline. Additionally, there are regulatory and infrastructure constraints related to the transportation of ethanol. These constraints, combined with the EPA's discretionionary authority under the Clean Air Act, make it unlikely that the EPA will reallocate the 2020 RFS volume to non-exempt obligated parties. Furthermore, the EPA has the authority to reopen and reallocate unused RFS volume allocations for 2019, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the affected parties. However, it is important to note that the EPA has not yet finalized the 2021 RFS rule and there is a possibility that the EPA may reallocate the 2021 RFS volume among the various obligated parties."

10,What is the basis for pricing in our Refining & Marketing contracts?,"• Refining & Marketing - The vast majority of our Refining & Marketing contracts contain pricing 
that is based on the market price for the product at the time of delivery. Our obligations to deliver 
product volumes are typically satisfied and revenue is recognized when control of the product 
transfers to our customers. Concurrent with the transfer of control, we typically receive the right to 
payment for the delivered product, the customer accepts the product and the customer has 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product. Payment terms require customers to pay 
shortly after delivery and do not contain significant financing components. 
• Midstream - Midstream revenue transactions typically are defined by contracts under which we 
sell a product or provide a service. Revenues from sales of product are recognized when control of 
the product transfers to the customer. Revenues from sales of services are recognized over time 
when the performance obligation is satisfied as services are provided in a series. We have elected 
to use the output measure of progress to recognize revenue based on the units delivered, processed 
or transported. The transaction prices in our Midstream contracts often have both fixed 
components, related to minimum volume commitments, and variable components, which are 
primarily dependent on volumes. Variable consideration will generally not be estimated at contract 
inception as the transaction price is specifically allocable to the services provided at each period 
end.

General guarantees associated with dispositions 
Over the years, we have sold various assets in the normal course of our business. Certain of the related 
agreements contain performance and general guarantees, including guarantees regarding inaccuracies in 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, and environmental and general indemnifications 
that require us to perform upon the occurrence of a triggering event or condition. These guarantees and 
159indemnifications are part of the normal course of selling assets. We are typically not able to calculate the 
maximum potential amount of future payments that could be made under such contractual provisions 
because of the variability inherent in the guarantees and indemnities. Most often, the nature of the 
guarantees and indemnities is such that there is no appropriate method for quantifying the exposure because 
the underlying triggering event has little or no past experience upon which a reasonable prediction of the 
outcome can be based.
Contractual Commitments and Contingencies
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our contractual commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment 
and advance funds to equity method investees totaled $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. 
Certain natural gas processing and gathering arrangements require us to construct natural gas processing 
plants, natural gas gathering pipelines and NGL pipelines and contain certain fees and charges if specified

Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) released the final Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (“SAFE”) Vehicles 
Rule setting corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) and carbon dioxide (“CO2”) standards for model 
years 2021 through 2026 passenger cars and light trucks. The final rule increases the stringency of CAFE 
and CO2 emission standards by 1.5 percent each year from model years 2021 through 2026. The rule has 
been challenged in court and could be revised by the Biden Administration through notice and comment

passenger vehicles in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Other states have, or may issue, zero-emission

technologies that increase fuel efficiency or offer alternative vehicle power sources and the proliferation of

15,How does the Group classify their financial assets?,"transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; c) the financial assets have 
been transferred and the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, but 
the Group has not retained control.
On derecognition of other equity instrument investments, the difference between the carrying amounts and the sum of the consideration 
received and any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, is recognised in retained earnings. While 
on derecognition of other financial assets, this difference is recognised in profit or loss.
(b) Financial liabilities
The Group, at initial recognition, classifies financial liabilities as either financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost or 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group ’s financial liabilities are mainly financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, including bills payable, accounts payable, other 
payables, loans and debentures payable, etc. These financial liabilities are initially measured at the amount of their fair value after deducting 
transaction costs and use the effective interest rate method for subsequent measurement.
Where the present obligations of financial liabilities are completely or partially discharged, the Group derecognises these financial liabilities 
or discharged parts of obligations. The differences between the carrying amounts and the consideration received are recognised in profit or 
loss.
(c) Determination of fair value
If there is an active market for financial instruments, the quoted price in the active market is used to measure fair values of the financial 
instruments. If no active market exists for financial instruments, valuation techniques are used to measure fair values. In valuation, the Group adopts valuation techniques that are applicable in the current situation and have sufficient available data and other information to support it, 
and selects input values that are consistent with the asset or liability characteristics considered by market participants in the transaction of 
relevant assets or liabilities, and gives priority to relevant observable input values. Use of unobservable input values where relevant observable input values cannot be obtained or are not practicable.
(d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. At each balance sheet date, the fair value is remeasured. The gain or 
loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting is a method which recognises the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item in the same accounting period, to represent the effect of risk management activities.","The Group classifies their financial assets based on criteria such as whether they are loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets. These classifications determine how the assets are measured and accounted for in the financial statements.",Sinopec_2020," The Group classifies their financial assets into different categories based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of cash flows of the financial assets. They classify financial assets into: (1) financial assets measured at amortised cost, (2) financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, (3) financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Additionally, they classify equity instruments into: (1) financial assets held for trading, (2) equity instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss."," The Group classifies their financial assets into different categories based on the business model for managing the assets and the contractual terms of cash flows. The categories are: (1) financial assets measured at amortised cost, (2) financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and (3) financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. The Group also considers other factors such as the Group’s power to control, the Group’s level of influence over the assets and the Group’s ability to liquidate the assets.

Subsequently, the liabilities are measured using the effective interest rate method, which takes into account the contractual cash flows and any changes in the carrying amount of the liabilities.",Sinopec_2020," Financial liabilities are initially measured at either amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss, depending on the nature of the liability. For amortised cost financial liabilities, the initial measurement is at the amount of the fair value of the liability after deducting transaction costs. For financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, the initial measurement is at the fair value of the liability."," The Group initially measures financial liabilities at fair value, including accounts payable, bills payable, other payables, and loans, etc. These financial liabilities are initially classified based on their contractual terms and the Group's assessment of the probability of default and expected recovery time.

The Group's policy is to maintain a prudent and conservative approach in its accounting for financial liabilities."

The Group ’s financial liabilities are mainly financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, including bills payable, accounts payable, other 
payables, loans and debentures payable, etc. These financial liabilities are initially measured at the amount of their fair value after deducting 
transaction costs and use the effective interest rate method for subsequent measurement.
Where the present obligations of financial liabilities are completely or partially discharged, the Group derecognises these financial liabilities 
or discharged parts of obligations. The differences between the carrying amounts and the consideration received are recognised in profit or 
loss.
(c) Determination of fair value
If there is an active market for financial instruments, the quoted price in the active market is used to measure fair values of the financial 
instruments. If no active market exists for financial instruments, valuation techniques are used to measure fair values. In valuation, the Group adopts valuation techniques that are applicable in the current situation and have sufficient available data and other information to support it, 
and selects input values that are consistent with the asset or liability characteristics considered by market participants in the transaction of 
relevant assets or liabilities, and gives priority to relevant observable input values. Use of unobservable input values where relevant observable input values cannot be obtained or are not practicable.
(d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. At each balance sheet date, the fair value is remeasured. The gain or 
loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting is a method which recognises the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item in the same accounting period, to represent the effect of risk management activities.","The Group uses different valuation techniques depending on whether there is an active market for the financial instruments or not. If there is an active market, the quoted price in that market is used as the fair value. If there is no active market, the Group uses valuation techniques that consider relevant observable input values and available data to determine fair value. This ensures that the fair value reflects the asset or liability characteristics as valued by market participants.",Sinopec_2020," The Group uses valuation techniques that are applicable in the current situation and have sufficient available data and other information to support it, and selects input values that are consistent with the asset or liability characteristics considered by market participants in the transaction of relevant assets or liabilities, and gives priority to relevant observable input values."," The Group uses observable input values for fair value measurement and adopts valuation techniques that are applicable in the current situation and have sufficient available data and other information to support it.

Use of unobservable input values is generally limited to specific circumstances where there is a lack of observable data.

Note: This question is a request for information about the Group's approach to fair value measurement and hedge accounting for derivative financial instruments. The Group's policy is to use observable input values for fair value measurement and adopt valuation techniques that are applicable in the current situation and have sufficient available data and other information to support it.

been transferred and the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, but 
the Group has not retained control.
On derecognition of other equity instrument investments, the difference between the carrying amounts and the sum of the consideration 
received and any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, is recognised in retained earnings. While 
on derecognition of other financial assets, this difference is recognised in profit or loss.

24,What was the operating expense of the refining and chemical production segment in 2020?,"the Company ’s refining and chemical 
production. Most of the natural gas and 
a small portion of crude oil were sold 
externally to other customers.
In 2020, the operating revenues of 
this segment was RMB 167.8 billion, representing a decrease of 20.4% over 
2019. This was mainly attributed to the 
decrease of realised price in crude oil, natural gas and LNG.
In 2020, the segment sold 34.52 million 
tonnes of crude oil, representing an 
increase of 0.5% over 2019. Natural 
gas sales volume was 27.8 billion cubic meters (bcm), representing a decrease 
of 3.6% over 2019. Regasified LNG sales 
volume was 15.7 bcm, representing an increase of 40.3% over 2019. LNG 
sales volume was 6.17 million tonnes, 
representing an increase of 30.2% over 2019. Average realised prices of crude 
oil, natural gas, Regasified LNG, and LNG 
were RMB 1,902 per tonne, RMB 1,360 per thousand cubic meters, RMB 1,774 
per thousand cubic meters, and RMB 
2,543 per tonne, representing decrease of 33.6%, 13.2%, 13.0%, and 23.1% 
respectively over 2019.In 2020, the operating expenses of 
this segment was RMB 184.2 billion, representing a decrease of 8.5% over 
2019. That was mainly due to the 
following:
• Procurement cost decreased by RMB 
12.0 billion year on year, as a result 
of decrease of LNG price;
• Depreciation, depletion and 
amortisation decreased by RMB 4.5 
billion year on year;
• Cost of power fuel and purchased 
materials decreased by RMB 2.1 
billion year on year;
• Resource Tax and special oil income 
levy decreased by RMB 2.0 billion year on year;
• Impairment losses on long-lived 
assets increased by RMB 7.9 billion 
year on year;
In 2020, the oil and gas lifting cost was RMB 729.59 per tonne, representing a 
year on year decrease of 6.7%, mainly attributable to the decrease in the cost 
of purchased material, fuels, and power 
since the upstream segment proactively reinforced the cost control to cope with 
the low oil price environment.In 2020, the operating loss of the 
exploration and production segment was RMB 16.5 billion, representing a decrease 
of RMB 25.8 billion compared with 
2019, mainly attributable to decrease of international oil prices.

customers.
In 2020, the operating revenues of 
this segment was RMB 944.5 billion, 
representing a decrease of 22.8% over 2019. This was mainly attributed to 
the decrease in products prices and 
crude oil throughput compared with the same period of last year as a result of","In 2020, the operating expenses of this segment amounted to RMB 184.2 billion, representing a decrease of 8.5% compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to cost reduction measures in procurement, depreciation, power fuels, purchased materials, and certain taxes, partially offset by an increase in impairment losses on long-lived assets.",Sinopec_2020," According to the table provided, the operating expenses of the refining and chemical production segment in 2020 were RMB 361,482 million, representing a decrease of 27.6% over 2019."," The operating expenses of the refining and chemical production segment in 2020 were RMB 184.28 million, representing a decrease of 8.4% compared to RMB 198.56 million in 2019.

15,What are the accounting methods used for downstream transactions involving business assets between the Group and its associate or joint venture?,"to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.The gain or loss resulting from a downstream transaction 
involving assets that constitute a business, as defined in IFRS 3, between the Group and its associate or joint veture is recognised in full in the consolidated financial statement.
A listing of the Group’s principal associates is shown in Note 17.
(c) Investments in joint ventures
Joint ventures are arrangements in which the Group with one or more parties have joint control, whereby the Group 
has rights to the net assets of the arrangements, rather than rights to their assets and obligations for their liabilities. The 
Group’s interests in joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting (Note 3(b)) in the consolidated financial statements. 
A listing of the Group’s principal joint ventures is shown in Note 17.
(d) Transactions with non-controlling interests
Transactions with non-controlling interests are treated as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners of 
the Group. Gains and losses resulting from disposals to non-controlling interests are recorded in equity. The differences 
between any consideration paid and the relevant share of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary acquired resulting from the purchase of non-controlling interests, are recorded in equity.
When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to 
its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. The amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2020 ANNUAL REPORT219
PETROCHINA COMPANY LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(All amounts in RMB millions unless otherwise stated)If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of 
the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
(e) Foreign currencies 
Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). Most assets and operations of the Group 
are located in the PRC (Note 39), and the functional currency of the Company and most of the consolidated subsidiaries is the Renminbi (“RMB”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in the presentation currency of RMB.","The gain or loss resulting from a downstream transaction involving assets that constitute a business, as defined in IFRS 3, between the Group and its associate or joint venture is recognised in full in the consolidated financial statement.",PetroChina_2020," According to the provided text, downstream transactions involving business assets between the Group and its associate or joint venture are recognized in full in the consolidated financial statements."," The Group uses the equity method of accounting for downstream transactions involving assets between the Group and its associate or joint ventures. This method is used to account for the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits or losses of associates.

30,What are proved developed oil and gas reserves?,"Proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered: 
a. Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required 
equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well.
b. Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the 
extraction is by means not involving a well.
Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on 
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
The taxes, fees and royalty in China are domestic tax schemes and are paid in cash to PRC authorities. The proved 
reserves includes quantities that are ultimately produced and sold to pay these taxes, fees and royalty.
Proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were based on reports prepared by DeGolyer and 
MacNaughton, Gaffney, Cline & Associates, McDaniel & Associates, Ryder Scott and GLJ independent engineering
