foundation created by our people and our culture. The environment in which we operate is dynamic. The biggest questions of the future remain unanswered. Our work is complex and demanding. Yet for 140 years, the ingenuity  
of our people has led to new insights, new discoveries and  
new innovations . 
This is not a coincidence. Our culture is 
defined by our values, which emphasize a 
deep commitment to diversity and inclusion, 
high performance, innovation, integrity,  
and trust. This has been part of our  
DNA for decades. 
To hold ourselves to this high standard — and to ensure an effective approach to human capital management — we regularly seek employee feedback to understand where Chevron is performing well and where we can further improve. Our Board of Directors takes this input seriously — and we act on it. Based on feedback, we are working to Build Our Tomorrow, by putting new digital technologies in the hands of employees, promoting better, faster decision making and revamping our performance management system. 
We use social media and other platforms to create access to 
information, remove organizational barriers, and bridge vast geographic expanses to exchange ideas and communicate. These are just some of the ways we put The Chevron Way to work, ensuring a culture in which all voices are heard, all ideas are considered and all our people have the opportunity to contribute to their fullest.
Actions like these are essential in today’s environment.

Although market conditions may remain volatile, our portfolio 
is resilient. We are focused on creating value through a disciplined capital program that prioritizes efficient, low-risk, short-cycle investments. Our Upstream portfolio is anchored by large, long-lived assets with low production decline. An efficient, high-return Downstream business complements our Upstream. Across all our business segments, we are accelerating the deployment of digital technologies to improve revenues, reduce costs, increase reliability and improve safety.

IIIIn every instance, Chevron’s performance rests on the strong 
foundation created by our people and our culture. The environment in which we operate is dynamic. The biggest questions of the future remain unanswered. Our work is complex and demanding. Yet for 140 years, the ingenuity  
of our people has led to new insights, new discoveries and  
new innovations . 
This is not a coincidence. Our culture is 
defined by our values, which emphasize a 
deep commitment to diversity and inclusion, 
high performance, innovation, integrity,  
and trust. This has been part of our  
DNA for decades. 
To hold ourselves to this high standard — and to ensure an effective approach to human capital management — we regularly seek employee feedback to understand where Chevron is performing well and where we can further improve. Our Board of Directors takes this input seriously — and we act on it. Based on feedback, we are working to Build Our Tomorrow, by putting new digital technologies in the hands of employees, promoting better, faster decision making and revamping our performance management system. 
We use social media and other platforms to create access to 
information, remove organizational barriers, and bridge vast geographic expanses to exchange ideas and communicate. These are just some of the ways we put The Chevron Way to work, ensuring a culture in which all voices are heard, all ideas are considered and all our people have the opportunity to contribute to their fullest.
Actions like these are essential in today’s environment.  
But we recognize that leadership goes well beyond 
delivering strong financial returns and creating a compelling work experience. We must also deliver value for society.declining in the last quarter. LNG markets continued to respond to strength in Asian gas demand. The return of U.S. sanctions on Iran, volatility in the Middle East, trade tensions between China and the United States, Russia sanctions, and worsening conditions in Venezuela created further uncertainty for global energy markets.
Although market conditions may remain volatile, our portfolio 
is resilient. We are focused on creating value through a disciplined capital program that prioritizes efficient, low-risk, short-cycle investments. Our Upstream portfolio is anchored by large, long-lived assets with low production decline. An efficient, high-return Downstream business complements our Upstream. Across all our business segments, we are accelerating the deployment of digital technologies to improve revenues, reduce costs, increase reliability and improve safety. We are making smart investments and building our company to win in any environment.
In 2018, we also had our best year ever in health, environment","Chevron's greenhouse gas emissions have declined in the last quarter due to factors such as the response to Asian gas demand, the return of U.S. sanctions on Iran, volatility in the Middle East, trade tensions between China and the United States, Russia sanctions, and worsening conditions in Venezuela, which created uncertainty for global energy markets."," In 2019, Chevron added a new metric to their corporate scorecard, tied to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They aimed to achieve a 20 to 25 percent reduction in methane emissions intensity and a 25 to 30 percent reduction in flaring intensity by 2023. Chevron's target is to achieve by 2023 a 20 to 25 percent reduction in methane emissions intensity and a 25 to 30 percent reduction in flaring intensity. Employee bonus compensation is tied to their performance on this scorecard.[\]

Chevron Corporation 2018 Annual Report
IIIIn every instance, Chevron’s performance rests on the strong 
foundation created by our people and our culture. The environment in which we operate is dynamic. The biggest questions of the future remain unanswered. Our work is complex and demanding. Yet for 140 years, the ingenuity  
of our people has led to new insights, new discoveries and  
new innovations . 
This is not a coincidence. Our culture is 
defined by our values, which emphasize a 
deep commitment to diversity and inclusion, 
high performance, innovation, integrity,  
and trust. This has been part of our  
DNA for decades. 
To hold ourselves to this high standard — and to ensure an effective approach to human capital management — we regularly seek employee feedback to understand where Chevron is performing well and where we can further improve. Our Board of Directors takes this input seriously — and we act on it. Based on feedback, we are working to Build Our Tomorrow, by putting new digital technologies in the hands of employees, promoting better, faster decision making and revamping our performance management system. 
We use social media and other platforms to create access to 
information, remove organizational barriers, and bridge vast geographic expanses to exchange ideas and communicate. These are just some of the ways we put The Chevron Way to work, ensuring a culture in which all voices are heard, all ideas are considered and all our people have the opportunity to contribute to their fullest.
Actions like these are essential in today’s environment.  
But we recognize that leadership goes well beyond 
delivering strong financial returns and creating a compelling work experience. We must also deliver value for society.declining in the last quarter. LNG markets continued to respond to strength in Asian gas demand. The return of U.S. sanctions on Iran, volatility in the Middle East, trade tensions between China and the United States, Russia sanctions, and worsening conditions in Venezuela created further uncertainty for global energy markets.
Although market conditions may remain volatile, our portfolio 
is resilient. We are focused on creating value through a disciplined capital program that prioritizes efficient, low-risk, short-cycle investments. Our Upstream portfolio is anchored by large, long-lived assets with low production decline. An efficient, high-return Downstream business complements our Upstream. Across all our business segments, we are accelerating the deployment of digital technologies to improve revenues, reduce costs, increase reliability and improve safety. We are making smart investments and building our company to win in any environment.

20,How much did Chevron invest in global goods and services over the last five years?,"In 2018, we also had our best year ever in health, environment 
and safety performance, with no fatalities of employees or contractors in any of our operations. We continue to lead the industry in personal safety performance and meet or exceed targets on all core personal safety metrics. This performance is directly related to our strong Operational Excellence culture and an increased focus on safeguard assurance for high-risk work.
Our success is inextricably linked to the social progress and economic prosperity of the communities where we work. Our operations deliver good jobs and a better life. They promote the development of communities and enable the economic progress that fosters environmental improvement. In our annual Corporate Responsibility Report,  available 
at www.chevron.com/cr , we highlight our performance in several environmental, social and governance areas. 
Over the last five years, Chevron invested $154 billion in global goods  
and services and more than $1 billion in global social programs.
We are in the business of progress, and we cannot do this work alone. Across the countries where we operate, we  rely on thousands of partners who help us convert our aspirations into real results. One such example is our support  of the Global Fund and its work in Africa and the Pacific Rim fighting HIV/AIDS. In 2018, the Global Fund directed  $2.5 million from Chevron to providing antiretroviral therapy to almost 20,000 people and helping reduce the mo
ther-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. Since 2008, we have provided more than $60 million to the Global Fund, 
contributing to its success in saving more than 27 million lives.record safety

needed to meet rising demand. By 2040, the global population is expected to reach roughly 9 billion people, and the International Energy Agency expects global energy demand to increase by nearly 30 percent. Our strengths across Upstream, Midstream and Downstream position  
us to help meet society’s growing need for energy. 
We will meet this demand in a way that respects society’s 
concerns about climate change and aspirations for a cleaner environment — views we share. This requires innovation. In 2018, we launched the $100 million Future Energy Fund, a venture capital fund established to invest in breakthrough technologies. Early investments include an electric vehicle charging network, novel battery technology and direct capture of carbon dioxide from the air.
We also joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI),  
a coalition of 13 global companies cooperating on 
constructive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Our commitment includes a $100 million contribution to

21,"What was Chevron's best year on record in terms of health, environment, and safety performance?","In 2018, we also had our best year ever in health, environment 
and safety performance, with no fatalities of employees or contractors in any of our operations.

This performance is directly related to our strong Operational Excellence culture and an increased focus on safeguard assurance for high-risk work.
Our success is inextricably linked to the social progress and economic prosperity of the communities where we work. Our operations deliver good jobs and a better life.

Over the last five years, Chevron invested $154 billion in global goods  
and services and more than $1 billion in global social programs.
We are in the business of progress, and we cannot do this work alone. Across the countries where we operate, we  rely on thousands of partners who help us convert our aspirations into real results. One such example is our support  of the Global Fund and its work in Africa and the Pacific Rim fighting HIV/AIDS. In 2018, the Global Fund directed  $2.5 million from Chevron to providing antiretroviral therapy to almost 20,000 people and helping reduce the mo

We continue to lead the industry in personal safety performance and meet or exceed targets on all core personal safety metrics. This performance is directly related to our strong Operational Excellence culture and an increased focus on safeguard assurance for high-risk work.
Our success is inextricably linked to the social progress and economic prosperity of the communities where we work. Our operations deliver good jobs and a better life. They promote the development of communities and enable the economic progress that fosters environmental improvement. In our annual Corporate Responsibility Report,  available 
at www.chevron.com/cr , we highlight our performance in several environmental, social and governance areas. 
Over the last five years, Chevron invested $154 billion in global goods  
and services and more than $1 billion in global social programs.
We are in the business of progress, and we cannot do this work alone. Across the countries where we operate, we  rely on thousands of partners who help us convert our aspirations into real results. One such example is our support  of the Global Fund and its work in Africa and the Pacific Rim fighting HIV/AIDS. In 2018, the Global Fund directed  $2.5 million from Chevron to providing antiretroviral therapy to almost 20,000 people and helping reduce the mo
ther-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. Since 2008, we have provided more than $60 million to the Global Fund, 
contributing to its success in saving more than 27 million lives.record safety

[\""]Chevron Corporation 2018 Annual Report
IIFinancial highlights
2018 was the year of our best
performance in a decade. We delivered on all of our financial priorities, investing in our future and creating value for our stockholders, customers and employees. Our strong results were driven by our Upstream business, which reported a world-class net oil-equivalent production increase of 7 percent. Our Downstream & Chemicals businesses continued to grow earnings across the value chain, and our Midstream business delivered safe and reliable operations. Our financial strength enabled us to invest in technology to solve the most complex challenges and leverage our financial strength to explore new possibilities.
Total net sales and other operating revenues1 for 2018 were $158.9 billion, up $13.7 billion from 2017. Our consolidated subsidiaries’ net production of oil-equivalent gas2 totaled 2.9 billion barrels in 2018, up from 2.7 billion barrels in 2017.
Earnings
Our consolidated subsidiaries’ net income for 2018 was $11.2 billion, up from $8.8 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher international oil-and-gas-producing business operations, refined product margins and lower tax expenses.
Debt
At year-end 2018, Chevron had $21.1 billion in debt, consisting primarily of commercial paper and medium-term notes. The company’s debt ratio, defined as debt excluding capital lease obligations divided by the sum of debt, capital lease obligations and marketable securities, was 17 percent at year-end 2018, compared with 19 percent at year-end 2017.
Stockholders’ Equity
Chevron Corporation stockholders’ equity at year-end 2018 was $141.8 billion.
Capital Program
In 2018, Chevron’s capital expenditures were $14.1 billion, up from $12.8 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher Upstream expenditures, including the start of construction on the LNG project in Australia, and higher Downstream and Midstream expenditures.
Dividends
In 2018, Chevron’s board of directors approved a record 63rd consecutive annual dividend increase, with a $1.59 per share payout, up from $1.55 per share in 2017. The annualized dividend rate at year-end 2018 was $6.90 per share.
Stock Repurchase Program

primary input, and they set humanity on a track to continuously seek more affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy inputs in order to meet increasing global demand created by a growing population and ambitions for prosperity. 
The diverse experience and expertise of Chevron’s Board play

By bringing together unique skills and qualifications developed through leadership in academia, business, finance and technology, as well as a diversity of gender, age, background and ethnicity, the Board

A: Our Board is highly focused on human capital management

stockholders in 2018?
A: An engagement team of Chevron officers and experts held 
productive meetings with stockholders in 2018 to discuss a 
variety of topics — from financial performance to environmental, social and governance matters. I participated in some of these engagements. Our investors took a strong interest in three areas: managing risks associated with climate change; ensuring transparency of lobbying practices and processes; and having more insight into human capital management. 
We are taking important actions in response to this dialogue. 
In February 2019, we announced new methane and flaring intensity reduction targets as we updated key sections of Climate Change Resilience — A Framework for Decision Making . 
We also took steps to provide more transparency in our lobbying activities by lowering the disclosure threshold —  
from $500,000 to $100,000 in annual dues — for trade association memberships wherein a portion of our dues may  
be used for lobbying purposes. And we are committed to  
more disclosure in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report","Our Board is highly focused on human capital management issues, reflecting our belief that Chevron’s greatest resources are human ingenuity and sense of purpose.

from $500,000 to $100,000 in annual dues — for trade association memberships wherein a portion of our dues may  
be used for lobbying purposes. And we are committed to  
more disclosure in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report","To ensure an engaged and inclusive work environment, Chevron values safety, The Chevron Way, and diversity of employees' talents and experiences. The company's Board reviews and approves executive compensation, executive selections and succession plans, and diversity and inclusion data.

43,What actions did Chevron take in response to the investor dialogue in 2019?,"energy transition as the first and second industrial revolutions

primary input, and they set humanity on a track to continuously seek more affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy inputs in order to meet increasing global demand created by a growing population and ambitions for prosperity.

Through these efforts, the Board continuously drives Chevron’s strategy and ensures  
that risks are understood and mitigated.
