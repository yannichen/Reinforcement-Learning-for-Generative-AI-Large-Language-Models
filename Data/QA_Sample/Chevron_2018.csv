Production increases were driven by Permian Basin growth, startups in the Gulf of Mexico and Australia, continued ramp-up of liquified natural gas (LNG) operations in Australia, and a high level of reliability at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan. We added approximately 1.46 billion barrels of net  
oil-equivalent proved reserves, replacing 136 percent","Chevron's debt ratio in 2018 was 18%, indicating a strong balance sheet and financial stability. The company has prudently managed its debt, which further enhances its ability to invest in growth opportunities and deliver value to its stockholders."

Chevron Corporation 2018 Annual Report
IIFinancial highlights from 2018 include: 
 
For the 31st consecutive year, Chevron increased the annual 
per-share dividend payout. We returned an additional  
$1.75 billion of cash to stockholders through stock  
repurchases. In addition, we further strengthened the  
balance sheet, reducing our debt ratio to 18 percent.
This performance reflects momentum across 
all our operating segments.

Production increases were driven by Permian Basin growth, startups in the Gulf of Mexico and Australia, continued ramp-up of liquified natural gas (LNG) operations in Australia, and a high level of reliability at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan. We added approximately 1.46 billion barrels of net  
oil-equivalent proved reserves, replacing 136 percent","Chevron's net production experienced a significant percentage increase from 2016 to 2018. It grew by 12% during this period, reaching more than 2.9 million oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2018. This growth is attributed to various factors, including the Permian Basin, Gulf of Mexico, Australia, and Kazakhstan, highlighting Chevron's ability to continuously expand its production capabilities."
How many blocks did Chevron acquire in the Gulf of Mexico?,"oil-equivalent proved reserves, replacing 136 percent  
of production. Our five-year reserve replacement ratio is  
117 percent. 
Chevron increased development drilling in the Permian Basin, 
and we expect continued strong production growth in the Permian over the next several years. We also acquired new exploration acreage, including six blocks in Brazil and 31 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. Construction continued on the Future Growth Project and Wellhead Pressure Management Project in Kazakhstan, including first module delivery and installation.
In Downstream & Chemicals, we commissioned a new hydrogen  
plant as part of the Richmond Refinery Modernization Project. 
In our Oronite additives business, we broke ground on our blending and shipping project in Ningbo, China. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company commissioned its world-scale ethane cracker at the Cedar Bayou facility as part of the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. We also expanded our new retail marketing network in Mexico, with 135 stations opened as of year-end 2018. 
Our Midstream business delivered the first LNG cargo from the 
Gorgon project to the new LNG receiving terminal in Zhoushan, China, an important achievement that will help China meet its goal of increasing natural gas in its overall energy mix. In the Permian Basin, Chevron strategically secured pipeline capacity to maximize value in advance of our production ramp-up. Our Shipping organization supported the safe and successful delivery of the first modular component to the Future Growth Project in Kazakhstan — a voyage of nearly 17,000 miles.
Chevron delivered these results in a year characterized by 
healthy global economic activity and heightened geopolitical tensions. Global liquids demand surpassed 100 million barrels a day for the first time ever. Commodity prices rose during the first nine months of 2018, driven by strong demand, before

Based on feedback, we are working to Build Our Tomorrow, by putting new digital technologies in the hands of employees, promoting better, faster decision making and revamping our performance management system. 
We use social media and other platforms to create access to 
information, remove organizational barriers, and bridge vast geographic expanses to exchange ideas and communicate. These are just some of the ways we put The Chevron Way to work, ensuring a culture in which all voices are heard, all ideas are considered and all our people have the opportunity to contribute to their fullest.
Actions like these are essential in today’s environment.  
But we recognize that leadership goes well beyond 
delivering strong financial returns and creating a compelling work experience. We must also deliver value for society.declining in the last quarter. LNG markets continued to respond to strength in Asian gas demand. The return of U.S. sanctions on Iran, volatility in the Middle East, trade tensions between China and the United States, Russia sanctions, and worsening conditions in Venezuela created further uncertainty for global energy markets.
Although market conditions may remain volatile, our portfolio 
is resilient. We are focused on creating value through a disciplined capital program that prioritizes efficient, low-risk, short-cycle investments. Our Upstream portfolio is anchored by large, long-lived assets with low production decline. An efficient, high-return Downstream business complements our Upstream. Across all our business segments, we are accelerating the deployment of digital technologies to improve revenues, reduce costs, increase reliability and improve safety. We are making smart investments and building our company to win in any environment.
In 2018, we also had our best year ever in health, environment","Chevron had its best year ever in health and environmental performance in 2018. They constantly seek employee feedback to understand where they can improve and make changes based on that feedback. They are committed to delivering value for society and prioritize creating a compelling work experience. Their portfolio is resilient, and they are focused on making smart investments and building their company to succeed in any environment."
How much did Chevron invest in global goods and services over the last five years?,"In 2018, we also had our best year ever in health, environment 
and safety performance, with no fatalities of employees or contractors in any of our operations. We continue to lead the industry in personal safety performance and meet or exceed targets on all core personal safety metrics. This performance is directly related to our strong Operational Excellence culture and an increased focus on safeguard assurance for high-risk work.
Our success is inextricably linked to the social progress and economic prosperity of the communities where we work. Our operations deliver good jobs and a better life. They promote the development of communities and enable the economic progress that fosters environmental improvement. In our annual Corporate Responsibility Report,  available 
at www.chevron.com/cr , we highlight our performance in several environmental, social and governance areas. 
Over the last five years, Chevron invested $154 billion in global goods  
and services and more than $1 billion in global social programs.
We are in the business of progress, and we cannot do this work alone. Across the countries where we operate, we  rely on thousands of partners who help us convert our aspirations into real results. One such example is our support  of the Global Fund and its work in Africa and the Pacific Rim fighting HIV/AIDS. In 2018, the Global Fund directed  $2.5 million from Chevron to providing antiretroviral therapy to almost 20,000 people and helping reduce the mo

Q: Tell us more about the Board’s role in human capital

A: Our Board is highly focused on human capital management 
issues, reflecting our belief that Chevron’s greatest resources 
are human ingenuity and sense of purpose. To ensure an engaged and inclusive work environment that values safety, The Chevron Way, and diversity of our employees’ talents and experiences, the Board reviews and approves executive compensation, executive selections and succession plans, and diversity and inclusion data. We regularly meet with employees at all levels and in different locations to observe firsthand how our investments in human capital are succeeding.Q: What were the key takeaways from meetings with 
stockholders in 2018?
A: An engagement team of Chevron officers and experts held 
productive meetings with stockholders in 2018 to discuss a 
variety of topics — from financial performance to environmental, social and governance matters. I participated in some of these engagements. Our investors took a strong interest in three areas: managing risks associated with climate change; ensuring transparency of lobbying practices and processes; and having more insight into human capital management. 
We are taking important actions in response to this dialogue. 
In February 2019, we announced new methane and flaring intensity reduction targets as we updated key sections of Climate Change Resilience — A Framework for Decision Making . 
We also took steps to provide more transparency in our lobbying activities by lowering the disclosure threshold —

What was the net income before tax in 2017 for Chevron Corporation?,"International income before tax increased from $2.16 billion in 2016 to $9.66 billion in 2017. This $7.50 billion increase was
primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices and gains on asset sales primarily in Indonesia and Canada. Thehigher crude prices primarily drove the $2.34 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-yearperiods, from $588 million in 2016 to $2.93 billion in 2017.

The company’s future debt level isdependent primarily onresults ofoperations, cash thatmay begenerated from asset
dispositions, thecapital program andshareholder distributions. Based onitshigh-quality debt ratings, thecompany believes
that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for

capital spending plans anddiscontinue orcurtail thestock repurchase program toprovide flexibility tocontinue paying the
common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.

87 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2017 and 90 percent in 2016. International upstream accounted for60 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2018, 69 percent in 2017 and 77 percent in 2016.
The company estimates that 2019 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $20 billion, including $6.3 billion of spending
by affiliates.

Approximately$10.4 billion of planned upstream capital spending relates to base producing assets, including $3.6 billion for the Permianand $1.6 billion for other shale and tight rock investments. Approximately $5.1 billion of the upstream program is plannedfor major capital projects underway, including $4.3 billion associated with the Future Growth and Wellhead PressureManagement Project at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. Global exploration funding is expected to be about $1.3 billion.Remaining upstream spend is budgeted for early stage projects supporting potential future developments. The company willcontinue to monitor crude oil market conditions and expects to further restrict capital outlays should oil price conditionsdeteriorate.
Worldwide downstream spending in 2019 is estimated to be $2.5 billion, with $1.5 billion estimated for projects in the
United States.
Investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2019 are budgeted at $0.2 billion.Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.2 billion at

Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term
liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories
are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2018, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs,based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $5.1 billion.
Interest Coverage Ratio Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized
interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the
company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2018 was higher than 2017and 2016 due to higher income.
Debt Ratio Total debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity, which indicates the

Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and
expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and
gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the futureunder existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developedand undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wellswith existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered fromnew wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required forrecompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include fieldperformance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs.
The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and
to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated FinancialStatements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
1. Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production
(UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOPbasis using total proved reserves. During 2018, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization(DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $14.8 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2018were 6.1 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOPcalculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOPDD&A in 2018 would have increased by approximately $800 million.
2. Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A
significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Provedreserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumesin the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairmentassessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.","Chevron uses the unit-of-production (UOP) method to depreciate its capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs.

Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered fromnew wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required forrecompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include fieldperformance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs.
The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and
to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated FinancialStatements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
1. Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production
(UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOPbasis using total proved reserves. During 2018, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization(DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $14.8 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2018were 6.1 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOPcalculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOPDD&A in 2018 would have increased by approximately $800 million.
2. Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A
significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Provedreserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumesin the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairmentassessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.","Chevron's UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) for oil and gas properties in 2018 amounted to $14.8 billion. This figure is calculated based on the depreciation and depletion of the capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs using the unit-of-production (UOP) method. It is an essential component of Chevron's financial statements and reflects the company's expenses related to its oil and gas properties."

Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and
expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and
gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the futureunder existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developedand undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wellswith existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered fromnew wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required forrecompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include fieldperformance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs.

What was the total pension expense for the company in 2018?,"For 2018, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent and a discount rate for service costs of
3.7 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 3.0 percent for U.S. pension plans. The actual return for 2018 wasnegative. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2018, actual asset returns averaged 7.9 percent for these plans. Additionally,with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for these plans equaled or exceeded6.75 percent during each year.
Total pension expense for 2018 was $1.1 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount
rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, whichaccounted for about 63 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2018by approximately $83 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pensionexpense for 2018 by approximately $271 million.
The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2018, was a net liability of approximately $3.9 billion. An increase
in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2018,the company used a discount rate of 4.2 percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of thesensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to thecompany’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation, wouldhave reduced the plan obligation by approximately $339 million, and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded statusfrom approximately $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion.

For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2018 was $123 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2018,
was $2.4 billion. For the main U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 3.8 percent and adiscount rate for interest cost of 3.2 percent to measure expense in 2018, and a 4.3 percent discount rate to measure thebenefit obligations at December 31, 2018.

3.7 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 3.0 percent for U.S. pension plans. The actual return for 2018 wasnegative. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2018, actual asset returns averaged 7.9 percent for these plans. Additionally,with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for these plans equaled or exceeded6.75 percent during each year.
Total pension expense for 2018 was $1.1 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount
rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, whichaccounted for about 63 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2018by approximately $83 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pensionexpense for 2018 by approximately $271 million.
The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2018, was a net liability of approximately $3.9 billion. An increase
in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2018,the company used a discount rate of 4.2 percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of thesensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to thecompany’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation, wouldhave reduced the plan obligation by approximately $339 million, and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded statusfrom approximately $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion.

Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax
matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For
example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws,opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation aresubject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional informationon the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.
Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the
loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling,general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for incometax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e.,likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income taxuncertainties, refer to Note 23 beginning on page 86. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this sectionfor the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for thethree years ended December 31, 2018.
An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities
is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions andthe wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policiesand procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recordedas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of managementand directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financialstatements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequatebecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

How are long-lived assets assessed for possible impairment?,"Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible
impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that cantrigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significantdecreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in theextent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset orasset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life.Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For provedcrude oil and natural gas properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, developmentarea or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, amarketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental“Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense.
Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with
its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impairedand adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 8, beginning on page 63, relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of aliability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of along-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 24, on page 88, relating to AROs.
Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral
interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reservesare produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using theunit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costsof unproved mineral interests are expensed.
The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In
general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line methodis generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets.
Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group","Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows.

impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that cantrigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significantdecreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in theextent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset orasset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life.Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For provedcrude oil and natural gas properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, developmentarea or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, amarketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate.

On January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) 2016-15 and 2016-18, which requireretrospective adjustment of prior periods in the Statement of Cash Flows.
In addition to other requirements, ASU 2016-15 specifies new standards for the classification of distributions from equity
affiliates. In adopting these new standards, Chevron utilized the cumulative earnings approach to evaluate returns on andreturns of investment from equity affiliates. For the year ended 2017 and 2016, a total of $166 and $322, respectively, wasreclassified from “Distributions less than income from equity affiliates” to “Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales andreturns of investment.”
Adoption of ASU 2016-18 requires the inclusion of restricted cash and associated changes in restricted cash in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The impact of ASU 2016-18 is captured across several line items in the Statement ofCash Flows, including “Net decrease (increase) in operating working capital,” “Decrease (increase) in other deferredcharges,” and “Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment” with associated net changes captured inboth “Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities” and “Net Cash Used for Investing Activities.” The line item “Net sales(purchases) of other short-term investments” was removed in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2016-18.
The table below quantifies the beginning and ending balances of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet:

2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2016-15 on a retrospective basis. The standard provides clarification on how certain cash
receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The adoption of thisASU did not have a material impact on the company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. For additional information,refer to Note 3 beginning on page 59.
Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash Effective January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2016-18 on a
retrospective basis. The standard requires an entity to explain the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted",The purpose of the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is to provide clarification on how these transactions are presented and classified. It helps in providing a clear and accurate representation of the cash flow activities of the company.
When did the Financial Accounting Standards Board issue ASU 2016-02?,"Leases (Topic 842) In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, which
became effective for the company January 1, 2019. The standard requires that lessees present right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company plans to elect the short-term lease exception provided for in thestandard and therefore will only recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year.The company further intends to elect the option to apply the transition provisions of the new standard at the adoption dateinstead of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The company plans to elect the package ofpractical expedients to not re-evaluate existing lease contracts or lease classifications and therefore will not make changes tothose leases already recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under ASC 840 until the leases are fully amortized,amended, or modified. In addition, the company will not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. The companyintends to apply the land easement practical expedient. Chevron plans to elect the practical expedient to not separatenon-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significantnon-lease (i.e., service) components in addition to the lease component. The company will reclassify some contracts,currently not classified as leases, as operating leases under the new standard.
The company completed accounting policy and disclosure updates and system implementation necessary to meet the
standard’s requirements. The company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material impact on finance leases,which are currently referred to as capital leases. The company estimates that the operating lease right-of-use assets and leaseliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are approximately $4 billion, as of January 1, 2019. The company expects theimplementation of the standard will have a minimal impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income and ConsolidatedStatement of Cash Flows.
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326) In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which becomes effective
for the company beginning January 1, 2020. The standard requires companies to use forward-looking information to

Management’s Assessment The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron,

Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environmentsurrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

District of New York against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters, alleging
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws. Through the civil lawsuit,Chevron sought relief that included a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the resultof fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. The trial commenced on October 15, 2013 and concludedon November 22, 2013. On March 4, 2014, the Federal District Court entered a judgment in favor of Chevron, prohibiting thedefendants from seeking to enforce the Lago Agrio judgment in the United States and further prohibiting them from profitingfrom their illegal acts. The defendants appealed the Federal District Court’s decision, and, on April 20, 2015, the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral arguments. On August 8, 2016, the Second Circuit issued a unanimous opinionaffirming in full the judgment of the Federal District Court. On October 27, 2016, the Second Circuit denied the defendants’petitions for en banc rehearing of the opinion on their appeal.

On June 19, 2017, the United States Supreme Court denied thedefendants’ petition for a Writ of Certiorari.
Management’s Assessment The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron,
remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in
this case. Due to the defects associated with the Ecuadorian judgment, management does not believe the judgment has anyutility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environmentsurrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells
The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when (a) the well has found asufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and (b) the business unit is making sufficientprogress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if thecompany obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, theexploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended

Employee Benefit PlansThe company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plansas required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States,all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. Thecompany does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws andregulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractivethan the company’s other investment alternatives.
The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as
life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees sharethe costs. For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retireemedical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an
asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Net actuarial losses recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at December 31, 2018, for the company’s U.S.pension, international pension and OPEB plans are being amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately 10, 12 and 13years, respectively. These amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected toreceive benefits under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of theprojected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The amount subject to amortization is determined on aplan-by-plan basis. During 2019, the company estimates actuarial losses of $239, $19 and $(3) will be amortized from“Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. In addition,the company estimates an additional $290 will be recognized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” during 2019related to lump-sum settlement costs from the main U.S. pension plans.
The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded in “Accumulated other

Expected Return on Plan Assets The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily
by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms
and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.
For 2018, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account
for 67 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In 2017, the company used a long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent forthese plans, and in 2016, 7.25 percent.
The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on
the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month timeperiod long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous tothe end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.
Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan
obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single","The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs recorded in 'Accumulated other comprehensive loss' at December 31, 2018, was approximately 4 and 8 years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, and 8 years for OPEB plans."

Expected Return on Plan Assets The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily
by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms
and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.
For 2018, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account
for 67 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In 2017, the company used a long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent forthese plans, and in 2016, 7.25 percent.
The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on
the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month timeperiod long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous tothe end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.

rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’splans and the yields on high-quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yieldcurve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2018were 4.2 percent for the main U.S. pension plan and 4.3 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan.

The effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2018were 4.2 percent for the main U.S. pension plan and 4.3 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for theseplans at the end of 2017 were 3.5 and 3.6 percent, respectively, while in 2016 they were 3.9 and 4.1 percent for these plans,respectively.
Other Benefit Assumptions Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2018, for
the main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.2 percent in 2019 and gradually decline to4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2017, the assumed health care cost-trend ratesstarted with 7.4 percent in 2018 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. A 1-percentage-point change inthe assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans:
1 Percent Increase 1 Percent Decrease
Effect on total service and interest cost components $ 12 $ (10)
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 197 $ (156)

The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of
risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequateliquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management.
The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 91 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans
have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assessthe plans’ investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.
For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company’s Investment Committee has established the following approved asset
allocation ranges: Equities 30–60 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 20–65 percent, Real Estate 0–15 percent, and AlternativeInvestments 0–15 percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following assetallocation guidelines: Equities 25–45 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 40–75 percent, and Real Estate 5–15 percent. Theother significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that varyby plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions andilliquidity constraints. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with activeinvestment managers and passive index funds.
The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2018, the company contributed $803 and $232 to its U.S. and international
pension plans, respectively. In 2019, the company expects contributions to be approximately $700 to its U.S. plans and $200
to its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pensionobligations, regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately berequired if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.","In 2018, the company contributed $803 million to its U.S. pension plans.

Other Contingencies and Commitments
Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject
to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period forwhich income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 16, beginning on page 74, for a discussion of the periods for whichtax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of thedifferences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to betaken in a tax return.
Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not
expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion ofmanagement, adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination.
Guarantees The company has two guarantees to equity affiliates totaling $968. Of this amount, $637 is associated with a
financing arrangement with an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 3-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum
amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate. The remaining amount of $331 is associated with certainpayments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 9-year remaining term ofthis guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerouscross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee.Chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee.
Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain
environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which had been reached at December 31, 2009.

Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject
to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period forwhich income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 16, beginning on page 74, for a discussion of the periods for whichtax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of thedifferences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to betaken in a tax return.
Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not
expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion ofmanagement, adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination.
Guarantees The company has two guarantees to equity affiliates totaling $968. Of this amount, $637 is associated with a
financing arrangement with an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 3-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum
amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate. The remaining amount of $331 is associated with certainpayments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 9-year remaining term ofthis guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerouscross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee.Chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee.
Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain
environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Underthe indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when theindemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen priorto the sale of the assets in 1997.
Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable,","Chevron has recorded no liability for the guarantees to equity affiliates. The company has two guarantees in total, with a total amount of $968. $637 of this amount is associated with a financing arrangement guarantee, while $331 is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement. Chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee."
Are there any long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments for the company in 2022?,"Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable,
the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. Thecompany does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay
Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional
purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drillships, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregateapproximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2019 – $1,300; 2020 – $1,200; 2021 –$1,300; 2022 – $1,000; 2023 – $800; 2023 and after – $4,700. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be sharedwith project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $1,400 in 2018, $1,300 in 2017 and $1,300in 2016.
As part of the implementation of ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842) effective January 1, 2019, the company will reclassify some
contracts, currently incorporated into the unconditional purchase obligations disclosure, as operating leases in first quarter2019 results.
Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal
proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the
company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleumsubstances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closedand divested sites, including, but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries,chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining sites.
Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is
likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fullydeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of thecorrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsibleparties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

Asset Retirement Obligations
The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liabilitywhen there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can bereasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertaintymay exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty aboutthe timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists toreasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset,(2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liabilityestimates and discount rates.
AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated
with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates forthe asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews ofits downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirementobligation.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2018, 2017 and 2016:
2018 2017 2016
Balance at January 1 $ 14,214 $ 14,243 $ 15,642

Balance at December 31 $ 14,050 $ 14,214 $ 14,243
In the table above, the amount associated with “Revisions in estimated cash flows” in 2018 reflects decreased cost estimates

The company applied the optional exemption to not report any unfulfilled performance obligations related to contracts that
have terms of less than one year. The amount of future revenue for unfulfilled performance obligations under long-termcontracts with fixed components was insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Revenue from contracts with customers is presented in “Sales and other operating revenue” along with some activity that is
accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606, which is not material to this line, on the Consolidated Statement of Income.Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (includingbuy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “purchased crude oil and products” on theConsolidated Statement of Income.

The most significant change is the presentation of excise, value-added and similar taxes collected on behalf of third parties,
which are no longer presented within “Sales and other operating revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income startingin 2018. These taxes, which totaled $7,861 in 2018, are now netted in “Taxes other than on income” on the ConsolidatedStatement of Income. This change to presentation had no impact on earnings. These taxes totaled $7,189 and $6,905 in 2017and 2016, respectively.
The company applied the optional exemption to not report any unfulfilled performance obligations related to contracts that
have terms of less than one year. The amount of future revenue for unfulfilled performance obligations under long-termcontracts with fixed components was insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Revenue from contracts with customers is presented in “Sales and other operating revenue” along with some activity that is
accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606, which is not material to this line, on the Consolidated Statement of Income.Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (includingbuy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “purchased crude oil and products” on theConsolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 13 beginning on page 66 for additional information on the company’ssegmentation of revenue.
Receivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $9,779 and$10,046 at January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable,net” represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from

Reserves Governance The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after
a system developed and approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum Congress and the American
Association of Petroleum Geologists. The company classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on theirstatus at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercialclassification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentiallyrecoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, theymust meet all SEC and company standards.
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operatingmethods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflectcontractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.
Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to
be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are thequantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively majorexpenditure is required for recompletion.
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as
additional information becomes available.
Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal
control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chairedby the Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the Upstream operating organization.

Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2018, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based
on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line
sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regionalgeologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Bothproprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismicprocessing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively bythe company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable andconsistent reserves estimates.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves At the end of 2018, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 4.6 billion barrels of oil-equivalent
(BOE), an increase of 317 million BOE from year-end 2017. The increase was due to 717 million BOE in extensions and
discoveries, 69 million BOE in acquisitions, 58 million BOE in revisions and 6 million BOE in improved recovery, partiallyoffset by the transfer of 531 million BOE to proved developed and 2 million BOE in sales. A major portion of this reserveincrease is attributed to the company’s activities in the Midland and Delaware basins.
During 2018, investments totaling approximately $10 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in
non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. In Asia,expenditures during the year totaled approximately $4.8 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCOaffiliate in Kazakhstan. The United States accounted for about $3.4 billion related primarily to various development activitiesin the Gulf of Mexico and the Midland and Delaware basins. In Africa, about $0.7 billion was expended on various offshoredevelopment and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada andArgentina were primarily responsible for about $0.9 billion of expenditures in Other Americas.
Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project
development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physicallimitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoirpressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.

Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements.This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of thereporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economicconditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition tothose future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes basedon appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discountfactors. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available.Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuationrequires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made asof December 31 each year and do not represent management’s estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oiland gas reserves. In the following table, the caption “Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardizedmeasure of discounted future net cash flows.

Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements.This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of thereporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economicconditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition tothose future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes basedon appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discountfactors. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available.Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuationrequires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made asof December 31 each year and do not represent management’s estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oiland gas reserves. In the following table, the caption “Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardizedmeasure of discounted future net cash flows.

and saleable hydrocarbons extracted from oil sands, shale, coalbeds and other nonrenewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas. Net proved reserves  are 
the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations and exclude royalties and interests owned by others. Estimates change as additional information becomes available. Oil-equivalent 
reserves  are the sum of the liquids reserves and 
the oil-equivalent gas reserves. See barrels of oil-equivalent  and oil-equivalent gas . The company 
discloses only net proved reserves in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors should refer to proved reserves disclosures in Chevron’s Annual Report on Form 10-K  for the year 
ended December 31, 2018.
Resources  Estimated quantities of oil and gas 
resources are recorded under Chevron’s 6P system, 
which is modeled after the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ Petroleum Resource Management System, and include quantities classified as proved, probable and possible reserves, plus those that remain contingent on commerciality. Unrisked resources, unrisked resource base  and similar terms represent 
the arithmetic sum of the amounts recorded under each of these classifications. Recoverable resources, potentially recoverable volumes  and","The contractor's share of PSC oil and/or gas production and reserves can vary over time due to several factors. The variation is dependent on prices, costs, and specific terms outlined in the production-sharing contract (PSC). Fluctuations in oil and gas prices directly impact the contractor's share, as higher prices can increase the profitability of production. Additionally, changes in costs, such as exploration, development, and production expenses, can affect the amount that the contractor can recover from the PSC. Finally, specific terms and conditions agreed upon in the PSC, including the government's royalty share and the contractor's income tax obligations, also influence the contractor's overall share of PSC production and reserves."
