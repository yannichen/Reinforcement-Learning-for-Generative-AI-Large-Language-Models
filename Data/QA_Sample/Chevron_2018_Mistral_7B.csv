On the other hand, Chevron's business activities are in several countries that are affected by geopolitical tensions, which can impact the profitability of its operations. For example, Chevron operates in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has been the site of ongoing tensions between the two countries.

Q: How important is Board refreshment and evaluation?
A: To understand and lead in a dynamic energy market, it is 
important that we constantly evolve, including the membership 
of our Board. We have experienced meaningful refreshment in recent years, resulting in average Board tenure of 4.7 years, with a range from less than one year to 14 years. Our Directors must have broad experience and expertise relevant to the changing needs of the company and our industry. 
To enable Board refreshment and regular rotation of Committee 
chairs, Directors are elected annually and serve for a one-year term or until their successors are elected. In addition, every year, the Board and its Committees conduct a comprehensive self-evaluation, and I lead a discussion of the results with the full Board. This year, we augmented our evaluation process to make evaluations of individual Director performance more rigorous.lead director: one-on-one
