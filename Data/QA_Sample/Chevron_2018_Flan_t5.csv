For the 31st consecutive year, Chevron increased the annual 
per-share dividend payout. We returned an additional  
$1.75 billion of cash to stockholders through stock  
repurchases. In addition, we further strengthened the  
balance sheet, reducing our debt ratio to 18 percent.
This performance reflects momentum across 
all our operating segments.
Our Upstream business reported a highest-ever worldwide net production of more than 2.9 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up more than 7 percent from 2017 and 12 percent from 2016. Production increases were driven by Permian Basin growth, startups in the Gulf of Mexico and Australia, continued ramp-up of liquified natural gas (LNG) operations in Australia, and a high level of reliability at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan. We added approximately 1.46 billion barrels of net  
oil-equivalent proved reserves, replacing 136 percent","Chevron's debt ratio in 2018 was 18%, indicating a strong balance sheet and financial stability.

IIIIn every instance, Chevron’s performance rests on the strong 
foundation created by our people and our culture. The environment in which we operate is dynamic. The biggest questions of the future remain unanswered. Our work is complex and demanding. Yet for 140 years, the ingenuity  
of our people has led to new insights, new discoveries and  
new innovations . 
This is not a coincidence. Our culture is 
defined by our values, which emphasize a 
deep commitment to diversity and inclusion, 
high performance, innovation, integrity,  
and trust. This has been part of our  
DNA for decades. 
To hold ourselves to this high standard — and to ensure an effective approach to human capital management — we regularly seek employee feedback to understand where Chevron is performing well and where we can further improve. Our Board of Directors takes this input seriously — and we act on it. Based on feedback, we are working to Build Our Tomorrow, by putting new digital technologies in the hands of employees, promoting better, faster decision making and revamping our performance management system. 
We use social media and other platforms to create access to 
information, remove organizational barriers, and bridge vast geographic expanses to exchange ideas and communicate. These are just some of the ways we put The Chevron Way to work, ensuring a culture in which all voices are heard, all ideas are considered and all our people have the opportunity to contribute to their fullest.
Actions like these are essential in today’s environment.  
But we recognize that leadership goes well beyond 
delivering strong financial returns and creating a compelling work experience. We must also deliver value for society.declining in the last quarter. LNG markets continued to respond to strength in Asian gas demand. The return of U.S. sanctions on Iran, volatility in the Middle East, trade tensions between China and the United States, Russia sanctions, and worsening conditions in Venezuela created further uncertainty for global energy markets.
Although market conditions may remain volatile, our portfolio 
is resilient. We are focused on creating value through a disciplined capital program that prioritizes efficient, low-risk, short-cycle investments. Our Upstream portfolio is anchored by large, long-lived assets with low production decline. An efficient, high-return Downstream business complements our Upstream. Across all our business segments, we are accelerating the deployment of digital technologies to improve revenues, reduce costs, increase reliability and improve safety. We are making smart investments and building our company to win in any environment.

20,How much did Chevron invest in global goods and services over the last five years?,"In 2018, we also had our best year ever in health, environment 
and safety performance, with no fatalities of employees or contractors in any of our operations. We continue to lead the industry in personal safety performance and meet or exceed targets on all core personal safety metrics. This performance is directly related to our strong Operational Excellence culture and an increased focus on safeguard assurance for high-risk work.
Our success is inextricably linked to the social progress and economic prosperity of the communities where we work. Our operations deliver good jobs and a better life. They promote the development of communities and enable the economic progress that fosters environmental improvement. In our annual Corporate Responsibility Report,  available 
at www.chevron.com/cr , we highlight our performance in several environmental, social and governance areas. 
Over the last five years, Chevron invested $154 billion in global goods  
and services and more than $1 billion in global social programs.
We are in the business of progress, and we cannot do this work alone. Across the countries where we operate, we  rely on thousands of partners who help us convert our aspirations into real results. One such example is our support  of the Global Fund and its work in Africa and the Pacific Rim fighting HIV/AIDS. In 2018, the Global Fund directed  $2.5 million from Chevron to providing antiretroviral therapy to almost 20,000 people and helping reduce the mo

The greatest challenge we face is affordably and reliably meeting the energy 
needs of a growing world population and at the same time reducing emissions. 
 yIn 2
019, we updated Climate Change Resilience — A Framework for Decision 
Making,  available at www.chevron.com/corporate-responsibility/climate-change , 
which explains our strategic approach as it relates to climate change, to enhance  
reporting on governance, risk management, strategy and actions. This report is consistent with the recommendations made by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.
 yIn 2
019, we added a new metric to our corporate scorecard tied to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. Chevron’s target is to achieve by 2023 a 20 to 25 percent reduction in methane emissions intensity and a 25 to 30 percent reduction in flaring intensity. Employee bonus compensation is tied to our performance on this scorecard.
