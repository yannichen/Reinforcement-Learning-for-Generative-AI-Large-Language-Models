24,"What is the expected global energy demand increase by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency?","In 2018, we also had our best year ever in health, environment 
and safety performance, with no fatalities of employees or contractors in any of our operations. We continue to lead the industry in personal safety performance and meet or exceed targets on all core personal safety metrics. This performance is directly related to our strong Operational Excellence culture and an increased focus on safeguard assurance for high-risk work.
Our success is inextricably linked to the social progress and economic prosperity of the communities where we work. Our operations deliver good jobs and a better life. They promote the development of communities and enable the economic progress that fosters environmental improvement. In our annual Corporate Responsibility Report,  available 
at www.chevron.com/cr , we highlight our performance in several environmental, social and governance areas. 
Over the last five years, Chevron invested $154 billion in global goods  
and services and more than $1 billion in global social programs.
We are in the business of progress, and we cannot do this work alone. Across the countries where we operate, we  rely on thousands of partners who help us convert our aspirations into real results. One such example is our support  of the Global Fund and its work in Africa and the Pacific Rim fighting HIV/AIDS. In 2018, the Global Fund directed  $2.5 million from Chevron to providing antiretroviral therapy to almost 20,000 people and helping reduce the mo
ther-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. Since 2008, we have provided more than $60 million to the Global Fund, 
contributing to its success in saving more than 27 million lives.record safety

Chevron Corporation 2018 Annual Report
IVWe provide the affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy 
needed to meet rising demand. By 2040, the global population is expected to reach roughly 9 billion people, and the International Energy Agency expects global energy demand to increase by nearly 30 percent. Our strengths across Upstream, Midstream and Downstream position  
us to help meet society’s growing need for energy. 
We will meet this demand in a way that respects society’s 
concerns about climate change and aspirations for a cleaner environment — views we share. This requires innovation. In 2018, we launched the $100 million Future Energy Fund, a venture capital fund established to invest in breakthrough technologies. Early investments include an electric vehicle charging network, novel battery technology and direct capture of carbon dioxide from the air.
We also joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI),  
a coalition of 13 global companies cooperating on 
constructive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Our commitment includes a $100 million contribution to 
OGCI’s more than $1 billion fund to invest in technologies and businesses that promise meaningful greenhouse gas emissions reductions.","According to the International Energy Agency, the global energy demand is expected to increase by nearly 30 percent by 2040, as the global population is expected to reach roughly 9 billion people.

This estimate takes into account various factors, including the growth of population, economic development, and changes in energy consumption patterns. It is important to note that the exact percentage increase in 2040 will depend on various factors, including the development of new technologies and the adoption of more efficient energy sources. However, the International Energy Agency's estimate provides a general understanding of the expected increase in energy demand by 2040."
