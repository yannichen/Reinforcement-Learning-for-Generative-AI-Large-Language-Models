As of December 31, 2018, we had 
three
 reportable segments as follows:
•
Refining segment
 includes our refining operations, the associated marketing activities, and certain logistics assets, which are not
owned by VLP, that support our refining operations;
•
Ethanol segment 
includes our ethanol operations, the associated marketing activities, and logistics assets that support our
ethanol operations; and
•
VLP segment
 includes the operations of VLP, which is a limited partnership that owns logistics assets that provide transportation
and terminaling services to our refining segment.
Financial information about these segments is presented in 
Note 17
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is
incorporated herein by reference.
Effective January 1, 2019, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker
manages and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of
the growing importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production. The
renewable diesel segment includes the operations of Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC (DGD), our consolidated joint venture as
discussed in 
Note 12
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The operations of DGD have been included in the refining segment
through 
December 31, 2018
, but were transferred from that segment on January 1, 2019. Also effective January 1, 2019, we no longer
have a VLP segment, and we include the operations of VLP in our refining segment. This change was made because of the Merger
Transaction with VLP, as defined and discussed in 
Note 2
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the resulting change in
how we manage VLP’s operations. We no longer manage VLP as a business but as logistics assets that support the operations of our
refining segment.

Benicia Refinery
. Our Benicia Refinery is located northeast of San Francisco on the Carquinez Straits of San Francisco Bay. It processes
sour crude oils into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and asphalt. Gasoline production is primarily California Reformulated Blendstock Gasoline
for Oxygenate Blending (CARBOB), which meets CARB specifications when blended with ethanol. The refinery receives crude oil
feedstocks via a marine dock and crude oil pipelines connected to a southern California crude oil delivery system. Most of the
refinery’s products are distributed via pipeline and truck rack into northern California markets.
Wilmington Refinery.
 Our Wilmington Refinery is located near Los Angeles, California. The refinery processes a blend of heavy and
high-sulfur crude oils. The refinery produces CARBOB gasoline, diesel, CARB diesel, jet fuel, and asphalt. The refinery is connected
by pipeline to marine terminals and associated dock facilities that move and store crude oil and other feedstocks. Refined petroleum
products are distributed via pipeline systems to various third-party terminals in southern California, Nevada, and Arizona.
Feedstock Supply
Our crude oil feedstocks are purchased through a combination of term and spot contracts. Our term supply agreements are at market-
related prices and are purchased directly or indirectly from various national oil companies as well as international and U.S. oil
companies. The contracts generally permit the parties to amend the contracts (or terminate them), effective as of the next scheduled
renewal date, by giving the other party proper notice within a prescribed period of time (e.g., 60 days, 6 months) before expiration of
the

current term. The majority of the crude oil purchased under our term contracts is purchased at the producer’s official stated price (i.e.,
the “market” price established by the seller for all purchasers) and not at a negotiated price specific to us.

(a)
Ethanol is commercially produced using either the wet mill or dry mill process. Wet milling involves separating the grain kernel into its component parts (germ, fiber, protein, and
starch) prior to fermentation. In the dry mill process, the entire grain kernel is ground into flour. The starch in the flour is converted to ethanol during the fermentation process,
creating carbon dioxide and distillers grains.

During fermentation, nearly all of the starch in the grain is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, while the remaining nutrients (proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins) are",We own 14 ethanol plants with a combined ethanol production capacity of 1.73 billion gallons per year.

(a)
Ethanol is commercially produced using either the wet mill or dry mill process. Wet milling involves separating the grain kernel into its component parts (germ, fiber, protein, and
starch) prior to fermentation. In the dry mill process, the entire grain kernel is ground into flour. The starch in the flour is converted to ethanol during the fermentation process,
creating carbon dioxide and distillers grains.

During fermentation, nearly all of the starch in the grain is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, while the remaining nutrients (proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins) are",The combined production of ethanol from our plants averaged 4.1 million gallons per day for 2018.

We sell our ethanol primarily to refiners and gasoline blenders under term and spot contracts in bulk markets such as New York,
Chicago, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Florida, and the U.S. West Coast. We also export our ethanol into the global markets. We ship our dry
distillers grains (DDGs) by truck or rail primarily to animal feed customers in the U.S. and Mexico. We also sell modified distillers
grains locally at our plant sites, and corn oil by truck and rail. We distribute our ethanol through logistics assets, which include railcars

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. Each of these risk
factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an
investment in our common stock.
Our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the
price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum
 
products.
Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for
crude oil and other feedstocks. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the
future. Our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several
factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks
and refined petroleum products. These in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production","In 2018, the capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations were $270 million."

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. Each of these risk
factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an
investment in our common stock.
Our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the
price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum
 
products.
Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for
crude oil and other feedstocks. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the
future. Our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several
factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks
and refined petroleum products. These in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production","The estimated capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations in 2019 are $170 million, and in 2020 are $15 million.

This long-term orientation underpins the Corporation's philosophy on talent development."
What are the principal environmental risks associated with our operations?,"refined petroleum products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.
Compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect
our performance.
The principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or
groundwater. Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of
materials into the environment, waste management,
14Table of Contents
pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and characteristics and composition of fuels, including gasoline and
diesel. Certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as
well as at formerly owned properties or third-party sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated.
Environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with
applicable requirements when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations,
we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned.
Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are
continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to GHG emissions and climate change, the level of expenditures
required for environmental matters could increase in the future. Current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could
result in changes to operating permits, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased
costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. We may be
required to make expenditures to modify operations, discontinue use of certain process units, or install pollution control equipment that
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
For example, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will be implementing a new regulation for a global sulphur cap for marine
bunker fuels by the year 2020 (IMO 2020). Under the IMO 2020 cap, vessels will be required to use marine fuels with a sulphur
content of no more than 0.50 percent beginning in January 2020, versus the current sulphur limit of 3.50 percent. While there are many
uncertainties, IMO 2020 could affect our business by creating the continued need for new and updated process units necessary to
produce the low sulphur marine fuel, and could increase the costs of our products.
In addition, in 2015, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the","The principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater.

In addition, in 2015, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the
creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the U.S. in April 2016, requires countries to review and
“represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set GHG emission reduction goals) every five
years beginning in 2020. While the current U.S. administration announced its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in June
2017, under the agreement’s terms the earliest the U.S. can withdraw is 2020. There are no guarantees that the agreement will not be re-
implemented in the U.S., or re-implemented in part by specific U.S. states or local governments. However, the Paris Agreement could
still affect our operations in Canada, the U.K., Ireland, and Latin America. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that
have been or may be imposed in various U.S. states, at the U.S. federal level, or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas
industry.
Severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.
Some members within the scientific community believe that the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the Earth’s
atmosphere, among other reasons, may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and
severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such climatic events were to occur, they could have an adverse
effect on our assets and operations.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) pursuant to the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable

2017, under the agreement’s terms the earliest the U.S. can withdraw is 2020. There are no guarantees that the agreement will not be re-
implemented in the U.S., or re-implemented in part by specific U.S. states or local governments. However, the Paris Agreement could
still affect our operations in Canada, the U.K., Ireland, and Latin America. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that
have been or may be imposed in various U.S. states, at the U.S. federal level, or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas
industry.
Severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.
Some members within the scientific community believe that the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the Earth’s
atmosphere, among other reasons, may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and
severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such climatic events were to occur, they could have an adverse
effect on our assets and operations.
Compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Renewable Fuel Standard could adversely affect our performance.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) pursuant to the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable
fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into
15Table of Contents
transportation fuels consumed in the U.S. A Renewable Identification Number (RIN) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel
produced in or imported into the U.S. As a producer of petroleum-based transportation fuels, we are obligated to blend renewable fuels
into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the U.S. EPA’s quota and, to the extent we do not, we must
purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program.","Compliance with the U.S. EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard could potentially affect our performance as a producer of petroleum-based transportation fuels. If we do not blend renewable fuels into our products at a rate that meets the U.S. EPA's quota, we must purchase Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) in the market to satisfy our obligation under the program."

We are exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. RINs prices are dependent
upon a variety of factors, including U.S. EPA regulations, the availability of RINs for purchase, and levels of transportation fuels
produced, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a
significantly higher price for RINs, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the U.S. EPA’s RFS mandates, our results of operations and
cash flows could be adversely affected.
Disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations
.
A significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, North
America, and South America. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business
with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, these areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if
political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but
it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are
able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including
reduced sales volumes of refined petroleum products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs.
In addition, the U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. These restrictions, and those
of other governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the U.S. and

Competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, own their own retail sites, have greater financial resources, or provide
alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage
.
The refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets.
We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined petroleum
products. We do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and, following the separation of our retail business in 2013, we do not
have a company-owned retail network. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from
company-owned production and some have extensive retail sites. Such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining
operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining
margins or feedstock shortages.
Some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. Such competitors have a greater
ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide
alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.","ExxonMobil currently uses rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain facilities and for the transportation of some manufactured products to their markets. The company owns and leases rail cars for these operations. However, rail transportation is subject to various federal, state, and local regulations, and compliance with these regulations can incur costs for owned and leased rail assets. The Corporation is also affected by new laws and regulations, as well as changes in existing ones, which may increase expenditures for compliance."

We currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the
products we manufacture to their markets. We own and lease rail cars for our operations. Rail transportation is subject to a variety of
federal, state, and local regulations. New laws and regulations, and changes in existing laws and regulations, are frequently enacted or
proposed, and could result in increased expenditures for compliance, either directly through costs for our owned and leased rail assets,
or as passed along to us by rail carriers and operators. For example, in the past several years, the Department of Transportation, the
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the Federal Railroad Administration have issued orders and rules, pursuant
to the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act of 2015 and other statutory authorities,
concerning such matters as enhanced tank car standards, operational controls, safety training programs, and notification requirements.

Uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and
can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners.
Our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. Our
ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which
could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of

be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have
an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to
us. In addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements.
Our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies.
We currently maintain investment-grade ratings by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings
on our senior unsecured debt. Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating
should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect
for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances so warrant. Specifically, if ratings agencies were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade,
our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could
decrease. In addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide
collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security, which would increase our operating costs. As a result, a downgrade below

and liabilities. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of
market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. In some instances,
certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane
damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for
which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty,

increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing
authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.
On December 22, 2017, tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform) was enacted. Among
other things, Tax Reform reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 
35
 percent to 
21
 percent and implements a new system of
taxation for non-U.S. earnings, including by imposing a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries. Tax Reform also generally will (i) limit our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30 percent of our
“adjusted taxable income” (plus 100 percent of our business interest income) for the year and (ii) permit us to offset only 80 percent
(rather than 100 percent) of our taxable income with any net operating losses we generate after 2017. We have evaluated the effects of
Tax Reform, including the one-time deemed repatriation tax and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the
provisions of Tax Reform, taken as a whole, did not have an adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, or financial
condition. We have used reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying Tax Reform, but it is possible that the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and
assumptions, which could adversely impact our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, and financial condition.

We currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. If the instruments we use to
hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. In addition, we may be required to incur additional

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK
Overview
For 
2018
, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of 
$3.1 billion
 compared to 
$4.1 billion
 for 
2017
, which
represents a decrease of 
$943 million
. This decrease is primarily due to a $1.9 billion tax benefit in 
2017
 resulting from Tax Reform,
which is discussed in 
Note 15
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by a $1.0 billion increase in income before
income tax expense. The increase in income before income tax expense is primarily due to higher operating income between the years
as described below.
Operating income was 
$4.6 billion
 for 
2018
 compared to 
$3.6 billion
 for 
2017
, which represents an increase of 
$1.0 billion
. Excluding
the adjustments to operating income reflected in the tables on page 
32
, adjusted operating income increased by $931 million in 2018
compared to 2017.
The $931 million increase in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the following:
•
Refining segment.
 Refining segment adjusted operating income increased $961 million primarily due to improved distillate
margins, favorable crude oil discounts, and lower costs of biofuel credits, partially offset by lower gasoline margins. This is
more fully described on pages 
36
 through 
37
.
•
Ethanol segment.
 Ethanol segment operating income decreased by 
$90 million
 primarily due to lower ethanol prices and higher
corn prices, partially offset by higher corn related co-products prices. This is more fully described on pages 
37
 through 
38
.
•
VLP segment.
 VLP segment adjusted operating income increased by $50 million primarily due to incremental revenues, partially
offset by higher cost of sales, generated from transportation and terminaling services associated with a terminal and a product
pipeline system acquired by VLP in November 2017 that were formerly a part of the refining segment. This is more fully
described on page 
38
.
•
Corporate and eliminations.
 Adjusted corporate and eliminations decreased by $10 million primarily due to expenses in 2017
associated with the termination of the acquisition of certain assets from Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (Plains). This is more
fully described on page

Outlook
Below are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2019:
•
Refining and ethanol margins are expected to remain near current levels.
•
Medium and heavy sour crude oil discounts are expected to remain weaker than their five-year averages as supplies of sour
crude oils available in the market remain suppressed.
•
Sweet crude oil discounts are expected to remain near current levels as export demand remains strong and freight costs continue
to rise. U.S. inland sweet crude oil discounts are also expected to remain wide with higher production and limited pipeline
capacity to transport crude oil out of the Permian Basin and other producing regions in the U.S.
•
Our refining operations in the U.K. could be adversely affected by Brexit, which is currently scheduled to occur on March 29,
2019. The U.K. and the European Union have yet to finalize the terms of Brexit, and the U.K.’s exit from the European Union
without an agreement on an overall structure for an ongoing relationship with the European Union could result in the imposition
of border controls and customs duties on trade that could negatively impact the operations of our Pembroke Refinery. While we
do not believe that Brexit will have a material impact on us, we are taking steps to minimize the impact of possible delays on
importing certain materials critical to our refining operations. The ultimate effect of Brexit will depend on the specific terms of
any agreement reached by the U.K. and the European Union. See Item 1A “Risk Factors”—

Outlook
Below are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2019:
•
Refining and ethanol margins are expected to remain near current levels.
•
Medium and heavy sour crude oil discounts are expected to remain weaker than their five-year averages as supplies of sour
crude oils available in the market remain suppressed.
•
Sweet crude oil discounts are expected to remain near current levels as export demand remains strong and freight costs continue
to rise. U.S. inland sweet crude oil discounts are also expected to remain wide with higher production and limited pipeline
capacity to transport crude oil out of the Permian Basin and other producing regions in the U.S.
•
Our refining operations in the U.K. could be adversely affected by Brexit, which is currently scheduled to occur on March 29,
2019. The U.K. and the European Union have yet to finalize the terms of Brexit, and the U.K.’s exit from the European Union
without an agreement on an overall structure for an ongoing relationship with the European Union could result in the imposition
of border controls and customs duties on trade that could negatively impact the operations of our Pembroke Refinery. While we
do not believe that Brexit will have a material impact on us, we are taking steps to minimize the impact of possible delays on
importing certain materials critical to our refining operations. The ultimate effect of Brexit will depend on the specific terms of
any agreement reached by the U.K. and the European Union. See Item 1A “Risk Factors”—
Changes in the U.K.’s economic
and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect us

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

operations. In addition, these tables include financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and represent non-GAAP

What is Valero Energy Corporation's philosophy on the use of non-GAAP financial measures?,"include adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, adjusted operating income, and refining and ethanol segment margin.
In note (h) to these tables, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful
information.
On January 10, 2019, we completed our acquisition of all the outstanding publicly held common units of VLP pursuant to the Merger
Agreement with VLP as defined and discussed in 
Note 2
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon completion of the Merger
Transaction, VLP became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Valero.

Revenues increased 
$23.1 billion
 in 
2018
 compared to 
2017
 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices associated
with sales made by our refining segment. This improvement in revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $22 billion
primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, and an increase of $96 million in general and administrative expenses
(excluding depreciation and amortization expense), resulting in an increase in operating income of 
$1.0 billion
 in 
2018
 compared to
2017
.
Excluding the adjustments to operating income reflected in the tables on page

by segment below.
Other income, net increased $18 million in 
2018

Diamond pipeline joint venture of $39 million and higher interest income of $29 million, partially offset by a $38 million charge from
the early redemption of debt as described in note (c) to the accompanying tables (see page 
45
).

Revenues increased 
$23.1 billion
 in 
2018
 compared to 
2017
 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices associated
with sales made by our refining segment. This improvement in revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $22 billion
primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, and an increase of $96 million in general and administrative expenses
(excluding depreciation and amortization expense), resulting in an increase in operating income of 
$1.0 billion
 in 
2018
 compared to
2017
.
Excluding the adjustments to operating income reflected in the tables on page

by segment below.
Other income, net increased $18 million in 
2018

45
).
Income tax expense increased 
$1.8 billion
 in 
2018
 compared to

Ethanol segment margin, as defined in note (h) to the accompanying tables (see page

), decreased $66 million in 
2018
 compared to
2017
, primarily due to the following:
•
Lower ethanol prices.
 Ethanol prices were lower in 
2018
 compared to 
2017
 primarily due to an increase in production. For
example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $1.48 per gallon for 
2018
 compared to $1.56 per gallon for 
2017
,
representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.08 per gallon. We estimate that the decrease in the price of ethanol had an
unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $159 million.
•
Higher corn prices.
 Corn prices were higher in 2018 compared to 2017. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) corn
price was $3.68 per bushel for 2018 compared to $3.59 per bushel for 2017, representing an unfavorable increase of $0.09 per
bushel. We estimate that the increase in the price of corn had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of
approximately $36 million.
•
Higher co-product prices.
 An increase in protein values, as compared to soybean meal, had a favorable effect on the prices
received for the corn related co-products that we produced. We estimate the increase in corn related co-product prices had a","Several factors contributed to the decrease in ethanol segment margin in 2018. Firstly, lower ethanol prices had an unfavorable impact, with the New York Harbor ethanol price decreasing from $1.56 per gallon in 2017 to $1.48 per gallon in 2018. This resulted in an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately $159 million. Secondly, higher corn prices also had an unfavorable impact, with the Chicago Board of Trade corn price increasing from $3.59 per bushel in 2017 to $3.68 per bushel in 2018. This resulted in an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately $36 million. Finally, although there was an increase in corn related co-product prices, it was not sufficient to offset the negative impact of lower ethanol and higher corn prices."

) of $28 million, higher chemicals and catalyst costs of $24 million, the effect from a favorable
insurance settlement of $20 million in 2017 for our McKee Refinery, and higher maintenance expense of $12 million.
Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased 
$63 million

128","In 2017, Valero Energy Corporation had total revenues of $93,980 million, an operating income of $3,563 million, and a net income of $4,065 million. Revenues from external customers amounted to $90,651 million, and intersegment revenues were $452 million. The company's total cost of sales was $89,475 million. These financial highlights demonstrate the company's strong performance and profitability in 2017."
What noncash benefit did the company record in the year 2016 as a result of a change in inventory valuation reserve?,"therefore we did not have a lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve as of those dates. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded
a change in our inventory valuation reserve that was established on December 31, 2015, resulting in a noncash benefit of $747 million, of which
$697 million and $50 million were attributable to our refining segment and ethanol segment, respectively.
(g)
Effective October 1, 2016 we (i) transferred ownership of all our assets in Aruba, other than certain hydrocarbon inventories and working capital, to
Refineria di Aruba N.V. (RDA), an entity wholly-owned by the Government of Aruba (GOA), (ii) settled our obligations under various agreements with
the GOA, including agreements that required us to dismantle our leasehold improvements under certain conditions, and (iii) sold the working capital of
our Aruba operations, including hydrocarbon inventories, to the GOA, CITGO Aruba Refining N.V. (CAR), and CITGO Petroleum Corporation (together
with CAR and certain other affiliates, collectively, CITGO). We refer to this transaction as the “Aruba Disposition.”
In June 2016, we recognized an asset impairment loss of $56 million representing all of the remaining carrying value of the long-lived assets of our crude
oil and refined petroleum products terminal and transshipment facility in Aruba (collectively, the Aruba Terminal). We recognized the impairment loss at
that time because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately transfer ownership of these assets to the GOA as a result of
agreements entered into in June 2016 between the GOA and CITGO for the GOA’s lease of those assets to CITGO.

We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts,
investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to
their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we

This impairment loss represented the remaining carrying value of the long-lived assets of the company's crude oil and refined petroleum products terminal and transshipment facility in Aruba, known as the Aruba Terminal. The recognition of this impairment loss was based on the assessment that it was more likely than not that the company would transfer ownership of these assets to the Government of Aruba (GOA) as a result of agreements entered into between the GOA and CITGO for the GOA's lease of the assets to CITGO."
What income tax benefit did the company recognize in 2016 as a result of cancelling outstanding debt obligations?,"therefore we did not have a lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve as of those dates. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded
a change in our inventory valuation reserve that was established on December 31, 2015, resulting in a noncash benefit of $747 million, of which
$697 million and $50 million were attributable to our refining segment and ethanol segment, respectively.

Effective October 1, 2016 we (i) transferred ownership of all our assets in Aruba, other than certain hydrocarbon inventories and working capital, to
Refineria di Aruba N.V. (RDA), an entity wholly-owned by the Government of Aruba (GOA), (ii) settled our obligations under various agreements with
the GOA, including agreements that required us to dismantle our leasehold improvements under certain conditions, and (iii) sold the working capital of
our Aruba operations, including hydrocarbon inventories, to the GOA, CITGO Aruba Refining N.V. (CAR), and CITGO Petroleum Corporation (together
with CAR and certain other affiliates, collectively, CITGO). We refer to this transaction as the “Aruba Disposition.”
In June 2016, we recognized an asset impairment loss of $56 million representing all of the remaining carrying value of the long-lived assets of our crude
oil and refined petroleum products terminal and transshipment facility in Aruba (collectively, the Aruba Terminal). We recognized the impairment loss at
that time because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately transfer ownership of these assets to the GOA as a result of
agreements entered into in June 2016 between the GOA and CITGO for the GOA’s lease of those assets to CITGO.

$13.26

$10.21
 per barrel for 2016, representing a favorable increase of $3.05 per barrel. Another example

$18.50

What was the primary reason for the decrease in income tax expense in 2017?,"segment below.
Income tax expense decreased $1.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the effect from a $1.9
 
billion income tax benefit
in 2017 resulting from Tax Reform, which is described in 
Note 15
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the income
tax adjustments reflected in the table on page 
41
 from both years, the effective tax rate for 2017 was 28
 
percent compared to 26
 
percent
for 2016. The effective tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35
 
percent that was in effect through December
 
31, 2017,
primarily because income from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the U.S. The effective
tax rate for 2016 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2017 due to a benefit in 2016 of $35
 
million resulting from the favorable

130,000 gallons per day in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reliability improvements. We estimate that the increase in
production volumes had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $25 million.
Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased $28 million primarily due to an
increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices ($2.98 per MMBtu for 2017 compared to $2.46 per MMBtu for 2016).
Ethanol segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased $15 million primarily due to the
write-off of assets that were idled in 2017.
VLP Segment Results
VLP segment revenues increased $89 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to $61 million of incremental revenues
generated from transportation and terminaling services associated with the Port Arthur terminal and the Parkway pipeline acquired by
VLP in 2017 and the McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers
50Table of Contents
terminals acquired by VLP in 2016 that were formerly a part of the refining segment. In addition, incremental revenues of $10 million
were generated from an undivided interest in the Red River crude system acquired in January 2017. The increase in VLP segment
revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $15 million primarily due to the costs to operate the acquired terminals, pipeline
and crude system, resulting in an increase in VLP segment operating income of $71 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the
adjustment reflected in the table on page

•
an increase in receivables resulting from an increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in commodity prices;
•
an increase in inventory primarily due to higher inventory levels;
•
a decrease in income taxes payable primarily resulting from (i) $527 million of payments in early 2018 related to 2017 tax
liabilities and (ii) $181 million of payments in late 2018 that will be applied to 2019 tax liabilities;

What is the allocation of capital investments in terms of sustaining capital and growth strategies for 2019 and 2020?,"We define capital investments as capital expenditures for purchases of, additions to, and improvements in our property, plant, and
equipment; turnaround and catalyst costs; and investments in joint ventures. Capital expenditures include the capital expenditures of our
consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs in which we hold an ownership interest.
Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of
property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and
supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the
addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts
significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for
improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan
for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external
factors.
We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations
with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability.
Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that
enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process
different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do
not increase throughput capacity significantly.
For both 
2019
 and 
2020
, we expect to incur approximately 
$2.5 billion
 for capital investments, consisting of approximately 
60
 percent
for sustaining capital and 
40
 percent for growth strategies. However, we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as
conditions warrant. This capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions, including acquisitions of undivided
interests.

What are the key assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs?,"are included in 
Note 15
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations
We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent
in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and
health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed and described in 
Note 13
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption
represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available
ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated
assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan
assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to
December 31, 2018
 was 9.38
 
percent. The actual return on assets for the years ended 
December 31, 2018
, 
2017
, and 
2016
 was
(5.53)
 percent, 
19.31
 percent, and 
7.77
 percent, respectively. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported
in our financial statements. The following sensitivity analysis shows the effects on the projected benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2019

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations
We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent
in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and
health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed and described in 
Note 13
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption
represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available
ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated
assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan
assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to

Inventory Valuation
The cost of our inventories is principally determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO approach.
Our LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and our non-LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. The market value of our LIFO inventories is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories.
We compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis, excluding materials and supplies. In determining the
market value of our inventories, we assume our refinery and ethanol feedstocks are converted into refined petroleum products, which
requires us to make estimates regarding the refined petroleum products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the
conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined petroleum products. We also estimate the usual and customary
transportation costs required to move the inventory from our refineries and ethanol plants to the appropriate points of sale. We then
apply an estimated selling price to our inventories. If the aggregate market value is less than cost, we recognize a loss for the difference
in our statements of income.

COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISK
We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and
regulatory environmental compliance programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are
deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not
record these contracts at their fair values. As of 
December 31, 2018
 and 
2017
, the amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative
instruments that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts was not material.

General
These consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2018 presentation. The changes were primarily due to our
retrospective adoption on January 1, 2018 of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits
(Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” This ASU requires
employers to report the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the same line
item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. It also requires the other
components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost (non-service cost components) to be presented in
the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The adoption of
this ASU did not affect our financial position or results of operations, but resulted in the reclassification of the non-service components
of pension and postretirement benefit costs from operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and general
and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) to other income, net. This resulted in an increase of
$42 million
 and 
$44 million
 in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and a decrease of

These consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2018 presentation. The changes were primarily due to our
retrospective adoption on January 1, 2018 of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits
(Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” This ASU requires
employers to report the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the same line
item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. It also requires the other
components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost (non-service cost components) to be presented in
the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The adoption of
this ASU did not affect our financial position or results of operations, but resulted in the reclassification of the non-service components
of pension and postretirement benefit costs from operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and general
and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) to other income, net. This resulted in an increase of
$42 million
 and 
$44 million
 in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and a decrease of 
$6 million
 and
$6 million
 in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) for the years ended 
December 31,

consolidation. Investments in less than wholly owned entities where we have significant influence are accounted for using the equity
method.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing
basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised
estimates.
Cash Equivalents
Our cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have a
maturity of three months or less when acquired.
Receivables
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is adjusted based on
management’s assessment of our customers’ historical collection experience, known credit risks, and industry and economic conditions.
Inventories
The cost of refinery feedstocks, refined petroleum products, and grain and ethanol inventories is determined under the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO approach, with any increments valued based on average purchase prices during the year.
Our LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of products purchased for resale and the cost of materials and
supplies are determined principally under the weighted-average cost method. Our non-LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost
or net realizable value. If the aggregate market value of our LIFO inventories or the aggregate net realizable value of our non-LIFO
inventories is less than the related aggregate cost, we recognize a loss for the difference in our statements of income.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
The cost of property, plant, and equipment (property assets) purchased or constructed, including betterments of property assets, is
capitalized. However, the cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets is expensed as incurred. Betterments of property
assets are those that extend the useful life, increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset, or improve the safety
of our operations. The cost of property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction
activities.
Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of

separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation
of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets
to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets,
and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite
groups range primarily from 
25

depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering
specifications, design standards, and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our
estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is
reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group.
Also under the composite method of depreciation, the historical cost of a minor property asset (net of salvage value) that is retired or
replaced is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in income. However, a gain or loss is recognized in
income for a major property asset that is retired, replaced, sold, or for an abnormal disposition of a property asset (primarily involuntary
conversions). Gains and losses are reflected in depreciation and amortization expense, unless such amounts are reported separately due
to materiality.

Impairment of Assets
Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash
flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized
for the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, with fair value determined based on
discounted estimated net cash flows or other appropriate methods.
We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying
amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value
of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in income, and is based on the difference between the
estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount.

Asset Retirement Obligations
We record a liability, which is referred to as an asset retirement obligation, at fair value for the estimated cost to retire a tangible long-
lived asset at the time we incur that liability, which is generally when the asset is purchased, constructed, or leased. We record the
liability when we have a legal obligation to incur costs to retire the asset and when a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability
can be made. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the liability is incurred, we record the liability when sufficient
information is available to estimate the liability’s fair value.
We have obligations with respect to certain of our assets related to our refining and ethanol segments to clean and/or dispose of various
component parts of the assets at the time they are retired. However, these component parts can be used for extended and indeterminate
periods of time as long as they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and current intent to maintain all our assets
and continue making improvements to those assets based on technological advances. As a result, we believe that our assets related to
our refining and ethanol segments have indeterminate lives for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations because dates or
ranges of dates upon which we would retire such assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. We will recognize a liability at such
time when sufficient information exists to estimate a date or range of potential settlement dates that is needed to employ a present value
technique to estimate fair value.
Environmental Matters
Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs
can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the

terminaling activities provided to our refining segment that are eliminated in consolidation. Revenues are recognized when we satisfy
our performance obligation to transfer products to our customers, which typically occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery of
the products, and for an amount that reflects the transaction price that is allocated to the performance obligation.
The customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the products at the point of shipment or
delivery. As a result, we consider control to have transferred upon shipment or delivery because we have a present right to payment at
that time, the customer has legal title to the asset, we have transferred physical possession of the asset, and the customer has significant
risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.
Our contracts with customers state the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price for goods sold. Payment is
typically due in full within two to ten days of delivery. In the normal course of business, we generally do not accept product returns.
The transaction price is the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for our products. The transaction price for

Legal Contingencies
We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. We accrue losses associated with
legal claims when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is probable and cannot estimate a
specific amount for that loss but can estimate a range of loss, the best estimate within the range is accrued. If no amount within the
range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. Estimates are adjusted as additional information
becomes available or circumstances change. Legal defense costs associated with loss contingencies are expensed in the period incurred.
Foreign Currency Translation
Generally, our international subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency. Balance sheet amounts are translated into
U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Income statement amounts are translated into U.S. dollars using
the exchange rates in effect at the time the underlying transactions occur. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The transaction price is the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for our products. The transaction price for
substantially all of our contracts is generally based on commodity market pricing (i.e., variable consideration). As such, this market
pricing may be constrained (i.e., not estimable) at the inception of the contract but will be recognized based on the applicable market
pricing, which will be known upon transfer of the goods to the customer. Some of our contracts also contain variable consideration in
the form of sales incentives to our customers, such as discounts and rebates. For contracts that include variable consideration, we
estimate the factors that determine the variable consideration in order to establish the transaction price.

On January 1, 2018, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with
Customers,” (Topic 606). This standard clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and supersedes previous revenue recognition
requirements under “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605).” We adopted the provisions of Topic 606 using the modified retrospective
method of adoption as permitted by the standard. Under this method, the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is
recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, and revenues reported in the periods prior to the date of
adoption are not changed.
 
We elected to apply the transition guidance for Topic 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of the
date of adoption. There was no material impact to our financial position as a result of adopting Topic 606; therefore, there was no

Hedging Activities,” (ASU No. 2017-12) to improve and simplify accounting guidance for hedge accounting. The provisions of this
ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within those annual
reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. Certain provisions of this ASU, primarily related to disclosures, require the prospective
method of adoption, with the remaining provisions applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
adoption date. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-12 effective January 1, 2019 did not affect our financial position or results of operations.
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted","The adoption of Topic 842, related to lease accounting, resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for Valero Energy Corporation's operating leases. It also led to the derecognition of existing assets under construction related to a build-to-suit lease arrangement.

the date of adoption as noted below, but we will apply the new disclosure requirements beginning in 2019.
The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients and we elected the following:
•
Transition Elections
. We elected the package of practical expedients that permits us to not reassess our prior conclusions about
lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs under the new standard, as well as the practical expedient that
permits us to not assess existing land easements under the new standard.
•
Lessee Accounting Policy Elections.
 We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption whereby right-of-use (ROU) assets
and lease liabilities are not recognized for leasing arrangements with terms less than one year, and the practical expedient to not
separate lease and non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets other than the marine transportation asset class.
In preparation for the adoption of Topic 842, we enhanced our contracting and lease evaluation systems and related processes, and we
developed a new lease accounting system to capture our leases and support the required disclosures. We have integrated our lease
accounting system with our general ledger and modified our related procurement and payment processes.
Adoption of this standard resulted in (i) the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for our operating leases of approximately
$1.3 billion

$539 million

$132 million
 was for working capital. This
acquisition, which is referred to as the Peru Acquisition, is consistent with our general business strategy and broadens the geographic
diversity of our refining segment. This acquisition was accounted for as a business acquisition.
The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, based on an

(defined below). We refer to this transaction as the “Aruba Disposition.” The agreements associated with the Aruba Disposition were
finalized in September 2016, including approval of such agreements by the Aruba Parliament. We no longer own any assets or have
any operations in Aruba.
In September 2016 and in connection with the Aruba Disposition, our U.S. subsidiaries were unable to collect outstanding debt
obligations owed to them by our Aruba subsidiaries, which resulted in the recognition by us of an income tax benefit in the U.S. of
$42 million
 during the year ended December 31, 2016. We had no income tax effect in Aruba from the cancellation of debt or other
effects of the Aruba Disposition because of net operating loss carryforwards associated with our operations in Aruba against which we
had previously recorded a full valuation allowance.
Prior to the Aruba Disposition, we recognized an asset impairment loss of 
$56 million
 in June 2016 representing all of the remaining
carrying value of our long-lived assets in Aruba. These assets were primarily related to our crude oil and refined petroleum products
terminal and transshipment facility in Aruba (collectively, the Aruba Terminal), which were included in our refining segment. We

We consolidate the financial statements of VLP (see 
Note 12

portion of VLP’s partners’ capital held by VLP’s public common unitholders. However, upon completion of the Merger Transaction,
VLP became our indirect wholly owned subsidiary and, as a result, we will no longer reflect noncontrolling interests on our balance
sheet with respect to VLP. In addition, we will no longer attribute a portion of VLP’s net income to noncontrolling interests. Because we
had a controlling financial interest in VLP before the merger and retained our controlling financial interest in VLP after the merger, the
change in our ownership interest in VLP as a result of the merger was accounted for as an equity transaction. Accordingly, we did not
recognize a gain or loss on the merger.

ARUBA DISPOSITION
Effective October 1, 2016, we (i) transferred ownership of all of our assets in Aruba, other than certain hydrocarbon inventories and
working capital, to Refineria di Aruba N.V., an entity wholly-owned by the Government of Aruba (GOA), (ii) settled our obligations
under various agreements with the GOA, including agreements that required us to dismantle our leasehold improvements under certain
conditions, and (iii) sold the working capital of our Aruba operations, including hydrocarbon inventories, to the GOA and CITGO
(defined below). We refer to this transaction as the “Aruba Disposition.” The agreements associated with the Aruba Disposition were
finalized in September 2016, including approval of such agreements by the Aruba Parliament. We no longer own any assets or have
any operations in Aruba.
In September 2016 and in connection with the Aruba Disposition, our U.S. subsidiaries were unable to collect outstanding debt
obligations owed to them by our Aruba subsidiaries, which resulted in the recognition by us of an income tax benefit in the U.S. of
$42 million
 during the year ended December 31, 2016. We had no income tax effect in Aruba from the cancellation of debt or other
effects of the Aruba Disposition because of net operating loss carryforwards associated with our operations in Aruba against which we
had previously recorded a full valuation allowance.
Prior to the Aruba Disposition, we recognized an asset impairment loss of 
$56 million
 in June 2016 representing all of the remaining
carrying value of our long-lived assets in Aruba. These assets were primarily related to our crude oil and refined petroleum products
terminal and transshipment facility in Aruba (collectively, the Aruba Terminal), which were included in our refining segment. We

Purchase Obligations
We have various purchase obligations under certain crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, industrial gas supply
arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), natural gas supply arrangements, and various throughput, transportation and
terminaling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of feedstock and utilities and adequate storage
capacity to operate our refineries and ethanol plants. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or
adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while
others are based on our usage requirements. None of these obligations is associated with suppliers’ financing arrangements. These
purchase obligations are not reflected as liabilities.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
Consolidated VIEs
In the normal course of business, we have financial interests in certain entities that have been determined to be VIEs. We consolidate a
VIE when we have a variable interest in an entity for which we are the primary beneficiary such that we have (i) the power to direct the
activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of or the
right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In order to make this determination, we evaluated
our contractual arrangements with the VIEs, including arrangements for the use of assets, purchases of products and services, debt,
equity, or management of operating activities.
The following discussion summarizes our involvement with our VIEs:
•
Prior to the completion of the Merger Transaction with VLP on January 10, 2019 as discussed in 
Note 2
, VLP was a publicly
traded master limited partnership whose common limited partner units were traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
trading symbol “VLP.” VLP was formed by us to own, operate, develop, and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products
pipelines, terminals, and other transportation and logistics assets. VLP’s assets include crude oil and refined petroleum products
pipeline and terminal systems in the U.S. Gulf Coast and U.S. Mid-Continent regions that are integral to the operations of 
ten
 of
our refineries. As of 
December 31, 2018
, we owned a
 
66.2
 
percent limited partner interest and a 
2.0
 percent general partner
interest in VLP, and public unitholders owned a 
31.8
 percent limited partner interest.
We determined VLP was a VIE because the public limited partners of VLP (i.e., parties other than entities under common
control with the general partner) lacked the power to direct the activities of VLP that most significantly impacted its economic
performance because they did not have
100Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
substantive kick-out rights over the general partner or substantive participating rights in VLP. Furthermore, we determined that","The net actuarial losses related to defined benefit pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2018, were $(63) million. This information is included in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Components section of the Statement of Income."

Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC (DGD) is a joint venture with Darling Green Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Darling
Ingredients Inc., that was formed to construct and operate a biodiesel plant that processes animal fats, used cooking oils, and
other vegetable oils into renewable green diesel. The plant is located next to our St. Charles Refinery and began operations in
June 2013. Our significant agreements with DGD include an operations agreement that outlines our responsibilities as operator
of the plant, a debt agreement whereby we financed approximately 
60
 percent of the construction costs of the plant, and a

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Non-Consolidated VIEs
We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. These non-
consolidated VIEs are not material to our financial position or results of operations and are primarily accounted for as equity
investments.
One
 of our non-consolidated VIEs is MVP, which is described in 
Note 10
. We have a 
50
 percent membership interest in MVP, which
was formed to construct, own, and operate the MVP Terminal. We determined MVP is a VIE because the power to direct the activities
that most significantly impact its economic performance is not required to be held by its 
two
 members, but is held by Magellan, as
operator under a construction, operating, and management agreement with MVP. For this reason and because Magellan holds a
50
 percent interest in MVP that provides it with significant economic rights and obligations, we determined that we are not the primary
beneficiary. As of 
December 31, 2018
, our maximum exposure to loss was
 
$247 million
, which represents our equity investment in
MVP. We have not provided any financial support to MVP other than amounts previously required by our membership interest.

Defined Benefit Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans, some of which are subject to collective bargaining agreements, that cover most of our
employees. These plans provide eligible employees with retirement income based primarily on years of service and compensation
during specific periods under final average pay and cash balance formulas. We fund our pension plans as required by local regulations.
In the U.S., all qualified pension plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act minimum funding standard. We","On December 31, 2018, Valero Energy Corporation's total assets were comprised of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $235 million, other current assets of $198 million, and property, plant, and equipment, netting to a value of $2,254 million."

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Non-Consolidated VIEs
We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. These non-
consolidated VIEs are not material to our financial position or results of operations and are primarily accounted for as equity
investments.
One
 of our non-consolidated VIEs is MVP, which is described in 
Note 10
. We have a 
50
 percent membership interest in MVP, which
was formed to construct, own, and operate the MVP Terminal. We determined MVP is a VIE because the power to direct the activities
that most significantly impact its economic performance is not required to be held by its 
two
 members, but is held by Magellan, as
operator under a construction, operating, and management agreement with MVP. For this reason and because Magellan holds a
50
 percent interest in MVP that provides it with significant economic rights and obligations, we determined that we are not the primary
beneficiary. As of 
December 31, 2018
, our maximum exposure to loss was
 
$247 million
, which represents our equity investment in
MVP. We have not provided any financial support to MVP other than amounts previously required by our membership interest.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Defined Benefit Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans, some of which are subject to collective bargaining agreements, that cover most of our
employees. These plans provide eligible employees with retirement income based primarily on years of service and compensation
during specific periods under final average pay and cash balance formulas. We fund our pension plans as required by local regulations.
In the U.S., all qualified pension plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act minimum funding standard. We","As of December 31, 2018, Valero Energy Corporation had a maximum exposure to loss amounting to $247 million. This represents their equity investment in MVP, a non-consolidated VIE that they hold a 50% membership interest in."

(a)","For Valero Energy Corporation's defined benefit plans, the benefit obligation refers to the amount of money that the company is obligated to pay in future pension benefits to its employees. The changes in benefit obligation include factors such as service cost, interest cost, participant contributions, benefits paid, actuarial gains or losses, and other adjustments. On the other hand, the fair value of plan assets represents the current value of the assets held by the pension plans. The changes in fair value of plan assets include actual investment returns, contributions made by Valero and participants, benefits paid, and other adjustments. The funded status of the plans is calculated by subtracting the benefit obligation from the fair value of plan assets, and it indicates whether the plans are overfunded or underfunded."

Plan assets include only the assets associated with pension plans subject to legal minimum funding standards. Plan assets associated with U.S.
nonqualified pension plans are not included here because they are not protected from our creditors and therefore cannot be reflected as a reduction from
our obligations under the pension plans. As a result, the reconciliation of funded status does not reflect the effect of plan assets that exist for all of our
defined benefit plans. See

Plan assets include only the assets associated with pension plans subject to legal minimum funding standards. Plan assets associated with U.S.
nonqualified pension plans are not included here because they are not protected from our creditors and therefore cannot be reflected as a reduction from
our obligations under the pension plans. As a result, the reconciliation of funded status does not reflect the effect of plan assets that exist for all of our
defined benefit plans. See

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The actuarial gain for the year ended 
December 31, 2018
 primarily resulted from an increase in the discount rates used to determine our
benefit obligations for our pension plans from 
3.58
 percent in 
2017
 to 
4.25
 percent in 
2018
. The actuarial loss for the year ended
December 31, 2017
 primarily resulted from a decrease in the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our pension
plans from 
4.08
 percent in 
2016
 to 
3.58
 percent in 
2017
.
The fair value of our plan assets as of 
December 31, 2018
 was unfavorably impacted by the negative return on plan assets resulting
primarily from a significant decline in equity market prices for the year. The fair value of our plan assets as of 
December 31, 2017
 was
favorably impacted by the return on plan assets resulting primarily from a favorable increase in equity market prices for the year.

The components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) other than the service cost component (i.e., the non-service cost components) are
included in other income, net in the statements of income.
Amortization of prior service credit shown in the preceding table was based on a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average
remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under each respective plan. Amortization of the net actuarial (gain)
loss shown in the preceding table was based on the straight-line amortization of the excess of the unrecognized (gain) loss over
10
 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets (smoothed asset value) over the
average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under each respective plan.

Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted, which resulted in significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code) and was effective beginning on January 1, 2018. The most significant changes affecting us are as follows:
•
reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 
35
 percent to 
21
 percent;
•
repeal of the manufacturing deduction;
•
deduction for all of the costs to acquire or construct certain business assets in the year they are placed in service through 2022;
•
shift from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system of taxation, resulting in a minimum tax on the income of
international subsidiaries (the GILTI tax) rather than a tax deferral on such earnings in certain circumstances; and
•
assessment of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits from our international subsidiaries.
The following narrative describes the activity that occurred with respect to Tax Reform for the years ended December 31, 2017 and
2018.
We reflected an overall income tax benefit of 
$1.9 billion
 for the year ended 
December 31, 2017
 with respect to Tax Reform as a result
of the following:
•
We remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using the 
21
 percent rate, which resulted in a tax benefit and a
reduction to our net deferred tax liabilities of 
$2.6 billion
.
•
We recognized a one-time transition tax of 
$734 million
 on the deemed repatriation of previously undistributed accumulated
earnings and profits of our international subsidiaries based on approximately 
$4.7 billion
 of the combined earnings and profits
of our international subsidiaries that had not been distributed to us. This transition tax will be remitted to the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) over the eight-year period provided in the Code, with the first annual remittance being paid in 2018.
•
We accrued withholding tax of 
$47 million
 on a portion of the cash held by one of our international subsidiaries that we have
deemed to not be permanently reinvested in our operations in that country.

subsidiaries are organized impose withholding taxes on cash distributed outside of those countries. As of

cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately 
$5.3 billion

portion of the cash held by one of our international subsidiaries that we have deemed to not be permanently reinvested in our
operations in that country. The remaining cash held by that subsidiary as well as our other international subsidiaries will be permanently
reinvested in our operations in those countries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that would be payable on

subsidiaries are organized impose withholding taxes on cash distributed outside of those countries. As of 
December 31, 2018
, the
cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately 
$5.3 billion
. We have accrued for withholding taxes on a
portion of the cash held by one of our international subsidiaries that we have deemed to not be permanently reinvested in our
operations in that country. The remaining cash held by that subsidiary as well as our other international subsidiaries will be permanently
reinvested in our operations in those countries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that would be payable on
those earnings, if distributed.

Receivables from Contracts with Customers
Our receivables from contracts with customers are included in receivables, net as presented in

Remaining Performance Obligations
The majority of our contracts with customers are spot contracts and therefore have no remaining performance obligations. Our
remaining contracts with customers are primarily term contracts. The transaction price for these term contracts includes an immaterial
fixed amount and variable consideration (i.e., a commodity price). The variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly
unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good that forms part of a single performance obligation; therefore, the variable consideration is
not included in the remaining performance obligation. As of 
December 31, 2018

duration of one year or less, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was not
material as the transaction price for these contracts includes only an immaterial fixed amount.

Effective January 1, 2019, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker
manages and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of
the growing importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production. The
renewable diesel segment includes the operations of DGD, our consolidated joint venture as discussed in 
Note 12
. The operations of
DGD have been included in the refining segment through 
December 31, 2018
, but were transferred from that segment on January 1,
2019. Also effective January 1, 2019, we no longer have a VLP segment, and we include the operations of VLP in our refining
segment. This change was made because of the Merger Transaction with VLP, as described in 
Note 2
, and the resulting change in how
we manage VLP’s operations. We no longer manage VLP as a business but as logistics assets that support the operations of our refining
segment.

As of 
December 31, 2018
 and

, our investments in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method were 
$542 million
 and
$530 million
, respectively, all of which related to the refining segment and are reflected in “deferred charges and other assets, net” as
presented in 
Note 7
.
Effective January 1, 2019, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker
manages and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of
the growing importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production. The
renewable diesel segment includes the operations of DGD, our consolidated joint venture as discussed in 
Note 12
. The operations of
DGD have been included in the refining segment through 
December 31, 2018
, but were transferred from that segment on January 1,
2019. Also effective January 1, 2019, we no longer have a VLP segment, and we include the operations of VLP in our refining
segment. This change was made because of the Merger Transaction with VLP, as described in 
Note 2
, and the resulting change in how
we manage VLP’s operations. We no longer manage VLP as a business but as logistics assets that support the operations of our refining
segment.

What is the company's approach to offsetting fair value amounts?,"fair values of financial instruments not recognized at fair value in our balance sheet is presented below under 
“Other Financial
Instruments.”
U.S. GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to
valuation techniques based on the degree to which objective prices in external active markets are available to measure fair value.
Following is a description of each of the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
•
Level 1 -
 Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 - 
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
•
Level 3 - 
Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about what market
participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances, which might include occasional market quotes or sales of similar instruments or our own financial data such as
internally developed pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value
determination requires significant judgment.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The following tables present information (in millions) about our assets and liabilities recognized at their fair values in our balance sheets
categorized according to the fair value hierarchy of the inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of 
December 31, 2018
 and
2017
.
We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative contracts executed with the same
counterparty, including any related cash collateral assets or obligations as shown below; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level
are presented in the following tables on a gross basis. We have no derivative contracts that are subject to master netting arrangements
that are reflected gross on the balance sheet.

A description of our assets and liabilities recognized at fair value along with the valuation methods and inputs we used to develop their
fair value measurements are as follows:
•
Commodity derivative contracts consist primarily of exchange-traded futures, which are used to reduce the impact of price
volatility on our results of operations and cash flows as discussed in 
Note 20
. These contracts are measured at fair value using
the market approach. Exchange-traded futures are valued based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange and are
categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
•
Physical purchase contracts represent the fair value of fixed-price corn purchase contracts. The fair values of these purchase
contracts are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange or an independent
pricing service and are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
•","The net carrying value of commodity derivative contracts on the balance sheet is $2,792 million."

A description of our assets and liabilities recognized at fair value along with the valuation methods and inputs we used to develop their
fair value measurements are as follows:
•
Commodity derivative contracts consist primarily of exchange-traded futures, which are used to reduce the impact of price
volatility on our results of operations and cash flows as discussed in 
Note 20
. These contracts are measured at fair value using
the market approach. Exchange-traded futures are valued based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange and are
categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
•
Physical purchase contracts represent the fair value of fixed-price corn purchase contracts. The fair values of these purchase
contracts are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange or an independent
pricing service and are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
•","The valuation methods and inputs used to develop the fair value measurements of assets and liabilities recognized at fair value are as follows: Commodity derivative contracts are measured using the market approach, specifically relying on quoted prices from the commodity exchange, and are categorized within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Physical purchase contracts are valued using a market approach, based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange or an independent pricing service, and are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy."

the price of credits needed to comply with various government and regulatory programs. We enter into derivative instruments to
manage some of these risks, including derivative instruments related to the various commodities we purchase or produce, and foreign
currency exchange and purchase contracts, as described below under 
“Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk.”
 These derivative
instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values (see

PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
We are exposed to market risks primarily related to the volatility in the price of commodities, and foreign currency exchange rates, and
the price of credits needed to comply with various government and regulatory programs. We enter into derivative instruments to
manage some of these risks, including derivative instruments related to the various commodities we purchase or produce, and foreign
currency exchange and purchase contracts, as described below under 
“Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk.”
 These derivative
instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values (see

Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by our international operations that are denominated in

we use foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting
purposes and therefore are classified as economic hedges. As of

deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not
record these contracts at their fair values. Certain of these programs require us to blend biofuels into the products we produce, and we
are subject to such programs in most of the countries in which we operate. These countries set annual quotas for the percentage of
biofuels that must be blended into the motor fuels consumed in these countries. As a producer of motor fuels from petroleum, we are
obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the applicable quota. To the degree we are
unable to blend at the applicable rate, we must purchase biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.). We are exposed to the volatility in

- As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of liability derivatives was $2,687 million, compared to $982 million as of December 31, 2017.

How does the company manage its exposure to market risk?,"December 31, 2018
, 
2017
, and 
2016
, the cost of meeting our obligations under these compliance
programs was 
$536 million
, 
$942 million
, and 
$749 million
, respectively. These amounts are reflected in cost of materials and other.
We are subject to additional requirements under GHG emission programs, including the cap-and-trade systems, as discussed in 
Note 19
.
Under these cap-and-trade systems, we purchase various GHG emission credits available on the open market. Therefore, we are
exposed to the volatility in the market price of these credits. The cost to implement certain provisions of the cap-and-trade systems are
significant; however, we recovered the majority of these costs from our customers for the years ended 
December 31, 2018
, 
2017
, and
2016
 and expect to continue to recover the majority of these costs in the future. For the years ended 
December 31, 2018
, 
2017
, and
2016
, the net cost of meeting our obligations under these compliance programs was immaterial.
Fair Values of Derivative Instruments
The following tables provide information about the fair values of our derivative instruments as of 
December 31, 2018
 and 
2017
(in millions) and the line items in the balance sheets in which the fair values are reflected. See 
Note 19
 for additional information related
to the fair values of our derivative instruments.
As indicated in 
Note 19
, we net fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative contracts executed with the same
counterparty under master netting arrangements, including cash collateral assets and obligations. The following tables, however, are
presented on a gross asset and gross liability basis, which results in the reflection of certain assets in liability accounts and certain
liabilities in asset accounts.
