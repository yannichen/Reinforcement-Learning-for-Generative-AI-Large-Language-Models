VALERO’S OPERATIONS
Effective January 1, 2019, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages
and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of the growing
importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production. The renewable diesel segment
includes the operations of DGD, which were transferred from the refining segment on January 1, 2019. Also effective January 1, 2019, we no","On January 31, 2020, Valero Energy Corporation had 10,222 employees."

under the trading symbol “VLO.” On January 31, 2020, we had 10,222 employees.
We own 15 petroleum refineries located in the United States (U.S.), Canada, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) with a combined throughput
capacity of approximately 3.15 million barrels per day (BPD). Our refineries produce conventional gasolines, premium gasolines, gasoline
meeting the specifications of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), diesel, low-sulfur diesel, ultra-low-sulfur diesel, CARB diesel, other
distillates, jet fuel, asphalt, petrochemicals, lubricants, and other refined petroleum products. We also own 14 ethanol plants located in the Mid-
Continent region of the U.S. with a combined production capacity of approximately 1.73 billion gallons per year. We are also a joint venture
partner in Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC (DGD), which owns and operates a renewable diesel plant in Norco, Louisiana. We sell our
products in the wholesale rack or bulk markets in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, and Latin America. Approximately 7,000 outlets carry
our brand names.

could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our
common stock.

"What factors affect our financial results, including the relationship between refined petroleum product prices and crude oil prices?","could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our
common stock.
Our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the price of
crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum products.
Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil
and other feedstocks. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. Our cost to
acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several factors beyond our control,
including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products. These
in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of U.S. and international suppliers, levels
of refined petroleum product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of U.S. and global economies, U.S. relationships with
foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation.
Some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. The
longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. We do not produce crude oil and must purchase
all of the crude oil we refine. We may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined
petroleum products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined petroleum products from these
feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. A decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our
inventories.
Economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the U.S. and
other countries. Lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and
consumption of our refined petroleum products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects.
Refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the
construction of new refineries. Worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined
petroleum product demand, which would have an adverse effect on refining margins.

First and foremost, the price of crude oil plays a significant role. As the primary input for refining operations, changes in crude oil prices can directly impact refining margins. Additionally, regional and global supply and demand dynamics for crude oil and refined petroleum products also contribute to the volatility. Factors such as the availability and quantity of imports, production levels of domestic and international suppliers, and levels of refined petroleum product inventories can influence refining margins. Moreover, the overall economic conditions, including productivity and growth of economies, political affairs, and governmental regulations, can further contribute to the volatility.

The regional and global supply of crude oil directly affects the availability and cost of feedstocks for the refining industry. Any disruptions or imbalances in the supply of crude oil can lead to fluctuating refining margins. For example, if there is an oversupply of crude oil in a specific region or globally, it can result in lower feedstock prices and potentially higher refining margins. Conversely, supply shortages or disruptions can lead to higher feedstock prices and adversely impact refining margins.

How can restrictions imposed by the U.S. government and other countries limit the company's business opportunities?,"traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be
unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at
unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined petroleum
products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs.
In addition, the U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. These restrictions, and those of other
governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the U.S. and other countries
have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future.
Any attempt by the U.S. government to withdraw from or materially modify existing international trade agreements could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The current U.S. administration has questioned certain existing and proposed trade agreements. For example, the administration withdrew the
U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In addition, the administration has
12Table of Contents
implemented and proposed various trade tariffs, which have resulted in foreign governments responding with tariffs on U.S. goods.
Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory, and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing,
development and investment could adversely affect our business. For example, the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers with other
countries could affect our ability to obtain feedstocks from international sources, increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our
products.
While there is currently a lack of certainty around the likelihood, timing, and details of any such policies and reforms, if the current U.S.
administration takes action to withdraw from, or materially modify, existing international trade agreements, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and the products
that we manufacture.
We use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market. If we
experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market, or if the ability of the pipelines, vessels, or
railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, derailment, collision, fire, explosion,
governmental regulations, or third-party actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and
liquidity.",The U.S. government and other governments can impose restrictions that limit the company's business opportunities in various countries. These restrictions can hinder the company's ability to access potential business opportunities and impact its operations. Historical and ongoing actions by both the U.S. government and other countries have demonstrated their influence on the company's operations. The uncertainty surrounding international trade agreements further adds to the potential limitations and challenges faced by the company in pursuing its business objectives globally.

We may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture.
We currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products
we manufacture to their markets. We own and lease rail cars for our operations. Rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal, state, and
local regulations, as well as industry practices and customs. New laws and regulations, and changes in existing laws and regulations, are
frequently enacted or proposed, and could result in increased expenditures for compliance, either directly through costs for our owned and
leased rail assets, or as passed along to us by rail carriers and operators. For example, in the past several years, the Department of
Transportation and various agencies within the Department of Transportation, including the Surface Transportation Board, the Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the Federal Railroad Administration, have issued orders and rules pursuant to the Federal
Railroad Safety Act of 1970, the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, Fixing
America’s Surface Transportation Act of 2015 and other statutory authorities concerning such matters as enhanced tank car standards, positive
train control and other operational controls, safety training programs, and notification requirements. The general trend has been toward greater
regulation of rail transportation over recent years. We do not believe these orders and rules will have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations, and liquidity, although further changes in law, regulations, or industry practices could require us to incur
additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us.

satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.
Uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can
adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners.
Our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. Our ability to
access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact
on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may
be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an
adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. In
addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements.
Our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We
currently maintain investment-grade ratings by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings on our
senior unsecured debt. Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be
evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given
period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant.","ExxonMobil operates in a highly complex, competitive, and changing global energy business environment where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. This long-term orientation underpins the Corporation's philosophy on talent development. The company places a strong emphasis on investing in the development of its employees, fostering a culture of continuous learning, and providing opportunities for growth and advancement. This philosophy allows ExxonMobil to build a talented workforce and adapt to the evolving energy landscape."
What are the potential consequences of a downgrade in our credit ratings?,"senior unsecured debt. Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be
evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given
period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant.
Specifically, if ratings agencies were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs may
increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. In addition, we may not
be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of
security, which would increase our operating costs. As a result, a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material
adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
From time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected
if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. From time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from
operations with proceeds from financing activities. We have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an
accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. In addition, we rely on the
counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements. Uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets
may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our
various financing facilities or our derivative instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations, and liquidity.

Workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements. To the extent we are in negotiations for labor
agreements expiring in the future, there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action.
Any prolonged strike, work stoppage, or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In
addition, future federal, state, or foreign labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs, especially during critical maintenance
periods.
We are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards.
Failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial
position, results of operations, and liquidity.
Our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and
natural catastrophes. As protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses and
liabilities. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market
conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. In some instances, certain insurance
could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and
coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
Our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. Significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the
financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. We can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the
full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events.
Large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate over time, negatively impacting project
returns.
We may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project.
Large-scale projects take many years to complete, and market conditions can change from our forecast. As a result, we may be unable to fully
realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross
receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and
changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax

liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.
On December 22, 2017, tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform) was enacted. Among other things,
Tax Reform reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and implemented a new system of taxation for non-U.S.
earnings, including by imposing a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Tax Reform also
generally (i) repealed the manufacturing deduction we previously were able to claim, (ii) resulted in a shift from a worldwide system of
taxation to a territorial system of taxation, resulting in a minimum tax on the income of international subsidiaries (the GILTI tax) rather than a
tax deferral on such earnings in certain circumstances, (iii) limits our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30 percent of our
“adjusted taxable income” (plus 100 percent of our business interest income) for the year and (iv) permits us to offset only 80 percent (rather
than 100 percent) of our taxable income with any net operating losses we generate after 2017. We have evaluated the effects of Tax Reform,
including the one-time deemed repatriation tax and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the provisions of Tax
Reform, taken as a whole, did not have an adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, or financial condition. We have used

January 31, 2020 to December 31, 2020, during which the trading relationship between the U.K. and the EU will remain the same while the
U.K. and the EU try to negotiate an agreement regarding their future trading relationship. The ultimate effects of Brexit will depend on whether
an agreement is reached, or on the specific terms of any such agreement that is reached, either of which outcomes could adversely impact the
ability to trade freely between the U.K. and the EU at the end of the transition period and could negatively impact our competitive position,
supplier and customer relationships, and financial performance.

If no agreement is reached, it could have a negative effect on these operations. The ultimate impact will depend on whether an agreement is reached and the specific terms of that agreement."
How does global concern about the coronavirus outbreak affect the company?,"transition period that is set to expire on December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the U.K. and the EU are expected to negotiate
a new free trade agreement, which could negatively impact the operations of our Pembroke Refinery and our marketing operations in
the U.K. and Ireland, as could the failure to reach any agreement. The ultimate effect of Brexit will depend on whether an agreement is
reached, or on the specific terms of any agreement that is reached by the U.K. and the EU. See Item 1A “RISK FACTORS”—Changes
in the U.K.’s economic and other relationships with the EU could adversely affect us.
•Global concern about the coronavirus outbreak could result in lower demand for and consumption of transportation fuels, which would
have a negative impact on our results of operations.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following tables, including the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial
measures in note (f) beginning on page 39, highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market reference prices that
directly impact our operations.
Effective January 1, 2019, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages
and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of the growing
importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production. The renewable diesel segment
includes the operations of DGD, which were transferred from the refining segment on January 1, 2019. Also effective January 1, 2019, we no
longer have a VLP segment, and we include the operations of VLP in our refining segment. This change was made because of the Merger
Transaction with VLP, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the resulting change in how we manage
VLP’s operations. We no longer manage VLP as a business but as logistics assets that support the operations of our refining segment. Our prior
period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation.

Revenues decreased by $8.7 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to decreases in refined petroleum product prices associated with
sales made by our refining segment. This decline in revenues was partially offset by lower cost of sales of $7.9 billion primarily due to
decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs and a decrease of $57 million in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation
and amortization expense), resulting in a decrease in operating income of $736 million in 2019 compared to 2018.
General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) decreased by $57 million in 2019 compared to 2018.
This decrease was primarily due to environmental reserve adjustments of $108 million associated with certain non-operating sites in 2018,
partially offset by increases in legal and other environmental reserves of $24 million and $12 million, respectively, as well as higher taxes other
than income taxes of $8 million and expenses associated with the Merger Transaction with VLP of $7 million.

operating income between the years are discussed by segment below.
“Other income, net” decreased by $26 million in 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest income of
$30 million and higher foreign currency transaction losses of $14 million, partially offset by the favorable effect of a $16 million lower charge
for the early redemption of debt between the periods. As described in note (d) on page 39, we redeemed debt in both 2019 and 2018 and
incurred early redemption charges of $22 million and $38 million, respectively.
Income tax expense decreased by $177 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. Our
effective tax rate was 20 percent for 2019 compared to 21 percent for 2018.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $131 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a $279 million
increase in blender’s tax credits recognized in 2019 compared to 2018, of which 50 percent is attributable to the holder of the noncontrolling

•Refining segment margin is primarily affected by refined petroleum product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks. The
market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of benchmark crude oils, such as Brent, WTI, and ANS. An
increase in the differential between the market price of the refined petroleum products that we sell and the cost of the reference
benchmark crude oil has a favorable impact on our refining segment margin, while a decline in this differential has a negative impact
on our refining segment margin. Additionally, our refining segment margin is affected by our ability to purchase and process crude oils
and other feedstocks that are priced at a discount to Brent and other benchmark crude oils. While we benefit when we process these
types of crude oils and other feedstocks, that benefit will vary as the discount widens or narrows. Improvement in these discounts has a
favorable impact on our refining segment margin as it lowers our cost of materials; whereas lower discounts result in higher cost of
materials, which has a negative impact on our refining segment margin. The table on page 29 reflects market reference prices and

other feedstock costs, resulting in a decrease in refining segment operating income of $1.1 billion in 2019 compared to 2018.
31Table of Contents
Refining segment adjusted operating income also decreased by $1.1 billion in 2019 compared to 2018. The components of this decrease, along
with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.
•Refining segment margin is primarily affected by refined petroleum product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks. The
market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of benchmark crude oils, such as Brent, WTI, and ANS. An
increase in the differential between the market price of the refined petroleum products that we sell and the cost of the reference
benchmark crude oil has a favorable impact on our refining segment margin, while a decline in this differential has a negative impact
on our refining segment margin. Additionally, our refining segment margin is affected by our ability to purchase and process crude oils
and other feedstocks that are priced at a discount to Brent and other benchmark crude oils. While we benefit when we process these
types of crude oils and other feedstocks, that benefit will vary as the discount widens or narrows. Improvement in these discounts has a
favorable impact on our refining segment margin as it lowers our cost of materials; whereas lower discounts result in higher cost of
materials, which has a negative impact on our refining segment margin. The table on page 29 reflects market reference prices and
differentials that we believe had a material impact on the change in our refining segment margin in 2019 compared to 2018. Refining
segment margin decreased by $853 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the following:","The refining segment margin decreased by $853 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to factors such as changes in refined petroleum product prices, market reference prices, and differentials between the market price of refined petroleum products and the cost of benchmark crude oils."

◦Lower discounts on crude oils had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $628 million.
◦Lower discounts on feedstocks other than crude oils, such as natural gas and residuals, had an unfavorable impact to our refining
segment margin of approximately $360 million.
◦A decrease in throughput volumes of 34,000 BPD had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately
$128 million.
◦A decrease in the cost of biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) had a favorable impact on our refining segment margin of
$218 million. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our government and
regulatory compliance programs.
◦An increase in distillate margins throughout most of our regions had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of
approximately $202 million.
•Refining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $135 million primarily due to
higher maintenance costs of $86 million, along with the effect of favorable property tax settlements of $20 million and sales and use
tax refunds of $17 million received in 2018 that did not recur in 2019.
•Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased by $152 million primarily due to
higher refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense of $82 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $79 million
associated with capital projects that were completed and finance leases that commenced in the latter part of 2018 and early 2019,
partially offset by the write-off of assets that were idled or demolished in 2018 of $15 million.

◦Higher ethanol prices had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $123 million.
•Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $34 million primarily due to costs
to operate the three plants acquired from Green Plains, Inc. (Green Plains) in November 2018 of $79 million, partially offset by lower

Refining segment revenues increased by $22.9 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices.
This improvement in refining segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $21.9 billion primarily due to increases in crude
oil and other feedstock costs, resulting in an increase in refining segment operating income of $936 million in 2018 compared to 2017.
Refining segment adjusted operating income increased by $902 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The components of this increase, along with
the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.
•Refining segment margin is primarily affected by refined petroleum product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks. The
market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of benchmark crude oils, such as Brent, WTI, and ANS. An
increase in the differential between the market price of the refined petroleum products that we sell and the cost of the reference
benchmark crude oil has a favorable impact on our refining segment margin, while a decline in this differential has a negative impact
on our refining segment margin. Additionally, our refining segment margin is affected by our ability to purchase and process crude oils
and other feedstocks that are priced at a discount to Brent and other benchmark crude oils. While we benefit when we process these
types of crude oils and other feedstocks, that benefit will vary as the discount widens or narrows. Improvement in these discounts has a
favorable impact on our refining segment margin as it lowers our cost of materials; whereas lower discounts result in higher cost of

Refining segment revenues increased by $22.9 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices.
This improvement in refining segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $21.9 billion primarily due to increases in crude
oil and other feedstock costs, resulting in an increase in refining segment operating income of $936 million in 2018 compared to 2017.
Refining segment adjusted operating income increased by $902 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The components of this increase, along with
the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.
•Refining segment margin is primarily affected by refined petroleum product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks. The
market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of benchmark crude oils, such as Brent, WTI, and ANS. An
increase in the differential between the market price of the refined petroleum products that we sell and the cost of the reference
benchmark crude oil has a favorable impact on our refining segment margin, while a decline in this differential has a negative impact
on our refining segment margin. Additionally, our refining segment margin is affected by our ability to purchase and process crude oils
and other feedstocks that are priced at a discount to Brent and other benchmark crude oils. While we benefit when we process these
types of crude oils and other feedstocks, that benefit will vary as the discount widens or narrows. Improvement in these discounts has a
favorable impact on our refining segment margin as it lowers our cost of materials; whereas lower discounts result in higher cost of
materials, which has a negative impact on our refining segment margin. The table on page 37 reflects market reference prices and

Ethanol segment revenues increased by $138 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in ethanol sales volumes. This
improvement in ethanol segment revenue was outweighed by higher cost of sales of $228 million, resulting in a decrease in ethanol segment
operating income of $90 million in 2018

along with the reasons for the changes in these components are outlined below.
•Renewable diesel segment margin increased by $116 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the following:
◦An increase in renewable diesel prices in 2018 had a favorable impact to our renewable diesel segment margin of $60 million.
◦Price risk management activities had a favorable impact to our renewable diesel segment margin of $40 million. We recognized a
hedge gain of $29 million in 2018 from commodity derivative instruments associated with our price risk management activities
compared to a loss of $11 million in 2017.
•Renewable diesel segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $19 million primarily
attributable to higher chemical and catalyst costs of $10 million and increased costs resulting from the expansion of the DGD Plant
completed in the third quarter of 2018 of $3 million.

Capital Investments
Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property
assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical
infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and
betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement
costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time
and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year
capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.
We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with
respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and
environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery
profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and
to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity
significantly.

Tax Matters
We take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority. When we take
such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if
any, that should be recognized in our financial statements. Tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits, which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained.
As of December 31, 2019, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, was $868 million. Of this
amount, $525 million is associated with refund claims associated with taxes paid
51Table of Contents
on incentive payments received from the U.S. federal government for blending biofuels into refined petroleum products. We recorded a tax
refund receivable of $525 million in connection with our refund claims, but we also recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
$525 million due to the complexity of this matter and uncertainties with respect to sustaining these refund claims. Therefore, our financial
position, results of operations, and liquidity will not be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in sustaining these refund claims. The
remaining liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, of $343 million represents our potential future

provisions of Tax Reform, but certain other taxes may apply, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain international

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides
further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with
Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting
policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our
financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the
sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number
of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
We take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority. When we take
such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if","The types of long-term liabilities described in Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements include purchase obligations, other long-term liabilities, and unrecognized tax benefits."

The evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials

Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using
currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental
liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such
remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors,

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations
We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these
valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost
trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed and described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these
assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve
comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating
agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is
representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of
asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to December 31, 2019 was 9.41 percent. The actual return on
assets for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was 23.44 percent, (5.53) percent, and 19.31 percent, respectively. These
assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements.

See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
Inventory Valuation
The cost of our inventories is principally determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO approach. Our
LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and our non-LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. The market value of our LIFO inventories is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories.
We compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis, excluding materials and supplies. In determining the market
value of our inventories, we assume that feedstocks are converted into refined products, which requires us to make estimates regarding the
refined products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined
products. We also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our plants to the appropriate
points of sale. We then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories. If the aggregate market value is less than cost, we recognize a loss
for the difference in our statements of income.

points of sale. We then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories. If the aggregate market value is less than cost, we recognize a loss
for the difference in our statements of income.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
COMMODITY PRICE RISK
We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate),
renewable diesel, grain (primarily corn), renewable diesel feedstocks, and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price
volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures and options to manage the
volatility of:
•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels
(determined on a LIFO basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels; and
•forecasted feedstock and refined petroleum product purchases, refined petroleum product sales, renewable diesel sales, or natural gas
purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable.
Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance
with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.","The market value of our inventories is determined by comparing the market value to the cost on an aggregate basis, excluding materials and supplies. In this determination, we consider the conversion of feedstocks into refined products, estimates of refined products expected to be produced, conversion costs, transportation costs, and estimated selling prices. If the aggregate market value is lower than cost, we recognize a loss for the difference in our statements of income."
What does the sensitivity analysis include in terms of derivative instruments?,"•forecasted feedstock and refined petroleum product purchases, refined petroleum product sales, renewable diesel sales, or natural gas
purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable.

10% decrease in underlying commodity prices 38 (6)
See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31,
2019.
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISK
We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory
environmental compliance programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable.
Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their
fair values. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would have resulted
from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts was not material. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial

Assessment of gross unrecognized tax benefits
As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, the Company has gross unrecognized tax
benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, of $897 million. The Company’s tax positions are subject to examination by local taxing
authorities and the resolution of such examinations may span multiple years. Due to the complexities inherent in the interpretation of
income tax laws in domestic and international jurisdictions, it is uncertain whether some of the Company’s income tax positions will be
sustained upon examination.
We identified the assessment of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because complex auditor judgment
was required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of income tax laws and assessing the Company’s estimate of the ultimate
resolution of its income tax positions.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over
the Company’s income tax process, including controls to evaluate which of the Company’s income tax positions may not be sustained upon
examination and estimate the gross unrecognized tax benefits.
We involved domestic and international income tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
•Obtaining an understanding and evaluating the Company’s income tax positions as filed or intended to be filed;
•Evaluating the Company’s interpretation of income tax laws by developing an independent assessment of the Company’s income
tax positions and comparing the results to the Company’s assessment;
•Inspecting settlements with applicable taxing authorities; and
•Assessing the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations.
In addition, we evaluated the Company’s ability to estimate its gross unrecognized tax benefits by comparing historical uncertain income","As of December 31, 2019, the Company has gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, of $897 million."

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
62Table of Contents
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Inventories
The cost of refinery feedstocks and refined petroleum products, grain and ethanol, and renewable diesel feedstocks (animal fats, used cooking
oils, and other vegetable oils) and renewable diesel is determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO
approach, with any increments valued based on average purchase prices during the year. Our LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost
or market. The cost of products purchased for resale and the cost of materials and supplies are determined principally under the weighted-
average cost method. Our non-LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. If the aggregate market value of our
LIFO inventories or the aggregate net realizable value of our non-LIFO inventories is less than the related aggregate cost, we recognize a loss
for the difference in our statements of income.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
The cost of property, plant, and equipment (property assets) purchased or constructed, including betterments of property assets, is capitalized.
However, the cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets is expensed as incurred. Betterments of property assets are those that
extend the useful life, increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset, or improve the safety of our operations. The cost of
property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction activities.
Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property
assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical
infrastructure (Units), and these Units are continuously improved. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of
existing Units. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing
internal and external factors.

We have obligations with respect to certain of our assets related to our refining and ethanol segments to clean and/or dispose of various
component parts of the assets at the time they are retired. However, these component parts can be used for extended and indeterminate periods
of time as long as they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and current intent to maintain all our assets and continue
making improvements to those assets based on technological advances. As a result, we believe that our assets related to our refining and ethanol
segments have indeterminate lives for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations because dates or ranges of dates upon which we
would retire such assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. We will recognize a liability at such time when sufficient information
exists to estimate a date or range of potential settlement dates that is needed to employ a present value technique to estimate fair value.
Environmental Matters
Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of
investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Amounts recorded for environmental liabilities have not been
reduced by possible recoveries from third parties and have not been measured on a discounted basis.
Legal Contingencies
We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. We accrue losses associated with legal
claims when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is probable and cannot estimate a specific amount
for that loss but can estimate a range of loss, the best estimate within the range is accrued. If no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. Estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes available or
circumstances change. Legal defense costs associated with loss contingencies are expensed in the period incurred.

products by our refining, ethanol, and renewable diesel segments. Revenues are recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to
transfer products to our customers, which typically occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery of the products, and for an amount that
reflects the transaction price that is allocated to the performance obligation.

In addition, we elected the transition practical expedient package that permits us to not reassess our prior conclusions about lease identification,
lease classification, and initial direct costs under the new standard, as well as the practical expedient that permits us to not assess existing land
easements under the new standard. See “Leases” above for a discussion of our revised accounting policy and also see Note 5 for information on

available cash on hand.
Prior to the completion of the Merger Transaction, we consolidated the financial statements of VLP (see Note 12) and reflected noncontrolling
interests on our balance sheet for the portion of VLP’s partners’ capital held by VLP’s public common unitholders. Upon completion of the
Merger Transaction, VLP became our indirect wholly owned subsidiary and, as a result, we no longer reflect noncontrolling interests on our
balance sheet with respect to VLP. In addition, we no longer attribute a portion of VLP’s net income to noncontrolling interests. Because we
had a controlling financial interest in VLP before the Merger Transaction and retained our controlling financial interest in VLP after the Merger
Transaction, the change in our ownership interest in VLP as a result of the merger was accounted for as an equity transaction. Accordingly, we
did not recognize a gain or loss on the Merger Transaction.
Acquisition of Ethanol Plants
On November 15, 2018, we acquired three ethanol plants from two subsidiaries of Green Plains Inc. for total cash consideration of $320 million
including working capital of $20 million. The ethanol plants are located in Bluffton, Indiana; Lakota, Iowa; and Riga, Michigan with a
combined ethanol production capacity of 280 million gallons per year. This acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition.
Peru Acquisition
On May 14, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Pure Biofuels del Peru S.A.C. (now known as
Valero Peru S.A.C.) (Valero Peru) from Pegasus Capital Advisors L.P. and various minority equity holders. Valero Peru markets refined
petroleum products through its logistics assets in Peru. Valero Peru owns a terminal at the Port of Callao, near Lima, with approximately
1 million barrels of storage capacity for refined petroleum and renewable products. Through one of its subsidiaries, Valero Peru also owns a
180,000-barrel storage terminal in Paita, in northern Peru, which is scheduled to commence operations in the second quarter of 2020, pending
regulatory approvals. This acquisition, which is referred to as the Peru Acquisition, was consistent with our general business strategy and
broadens the geographic diversity of our refining segment. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.

Consolidated VIEs
In the normal course of business, we have financial interests in certain entities that have been determined to be VIEs. We consolidate a VIE
when we have a variable interest in an entity for which we are the primary beneficiary such that we have (i) the power to direct the activities of
the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive
benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In order to make this determination, we evaluated our contractual
arrangements with the VIEs, including arrangements for the use of assets, purchases of products and services, debt, equity, or management of
operating activities.
The following discussion summarizes our involvement with our VIEs:
•DGD is a joint venture with a subsidiary of Darling Ingredients Inc. that owns and operates a plant that processes animal fats, used
cooking oils, and other vegetable oils into renewable diesel. The plant is located in Norco, Louisiana next to our St. Charles Refinery.

12.VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
Consolidated VIEs
In the normal course of business, we have financial interests in certain entities that have been determined to be VIEs. We consolidate a VIE
when we have a variable interest in an entity for which we are the primary beneficiary such that we have (i) the power to direct the activities of
the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive
benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In order to make this determination, we evaluated our contractual
arrangements with the VIEs, including arrangements for the use of assets, purchases of products and services, debt, equity, or management of
operating activities.
The following discussion summarizes our involvement with our VIEs:
•DGD is a joint venture with a subsidiary of Darling Ingredients Inc. that owns and operates a plant that processes animal fats, used
cooking oils, and other vegetable oils into renewable diesel. The plant is located in Norco, Louisiana next to our St. Charles Refinery.
Our significant agreements with DGD include an operations agreement that outlines our responsibilities as operator of the plant and a
marketing agreement.

(a)Prior to the completion of the Merger Transaction with VLP on January 10, 2019 as discussed in Note 2, VLP was a publicly traded master limited
partnership that we had determined was a VIE. VLP was formed by us to own, operate, develop, and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products
pipelines, terminals, and other transportation and logistics assets. As of December 31, 2018, we owned a 66.2 percent limited partner interest and a
2.0 percent general partner interest in VLP, and public unitholders owned a 31.8 percent limited partner interest. Upon completion of the Merger
Transaction, VLP became our indirect wholly owned subsidiary and, as a result, was no longer a VIE.
Non-Consolidated VIEs
We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. These non-

Defined Benefit Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans, some of which are subject to collective bargaining agreements, that cover most of our employees. These
plans provide eligible employees with retirement income based primarily on years of service and compensation during specific periods under
final average pay and cash balance formulas. We fund our pension plans as required by local regulations. In the U.S., all qualified pension plans
are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act’s minimum funding standard. We typically do not fund or fully fund U.S.
nonqualified and certain international pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements because contributions to these pension plans
may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than our other investment alternatives.
We also provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees through our postretirement benefit plans. Most of our
employees become eligible for these benefits if, while still working for us, they reach normal retirement age or take early retirement. These
plans are unfunded, and retired employees share the cost with us. Individuals who became our employees as a result of an acquisition became
eligible for postretirement benefits under our plans as determined by the terms of the relevant acquisition agreement.

Amortization of prior service credit shown in the preceding table was based on a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average
remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under each respective plan. Amortization of the net actuarial (gain) loss
shown in the preceding table was based on the straight-line amortization of the excess of the unrecognized (gain) loss over 10 percent of the
greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets (smoothed asset value) over the average remaining service
period of active employees expected to receive benefits under each respective plan.

international stocks and a blend of U.S. growth and value stocks of various sizes of capitalization. Fixed income securities include bonds and

We had the following income tax credit and loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 (in millions):
 Amount  Expiration
U.S. state income tax credits (gross amount) $ 89 2020 through 2033
U.S. state income tax credits (gross amount) 17 Unlimited
U.S. foreign tax credits 598 2027
U.S. state NOLs (gross amount) 10,913 2020 through 2039
We have recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our
deferred income tax assets associated with our U.S. foreign tax credits and certain U.S. state income tax credits and NOLs before they expire.
The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over
which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable. The valuation allowance increased by $89 million in 2019 primarily due to an increase in
excess U.S. foreign tax credits as well as U.S. state income tax NOLs.
As a part of completing our accounting for Tax Reform in 2018 as described in “Tax Reform” below, we assessed our ability to use our foreign
tax credits to offset the tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings and profits of our international subsidiaries and concluded
that our foreign tax credit carryforwards were not more likely than not to be realized, and we recorded a full valuation allowance against the
deferred income tax asset associated with those carryforwards.
As described in “Tax Reform” below, one of the most significant changes in Tax Reform was the shift from a worldwide system of taxation to a
hybrid territorial system. The shift to a hybrid territorial system allows us to distribute cash via a dividend from our international subsidiaries
with a full dividend received deduction in the U.S. As a result, we will not recognize U.S. federal deferred taxes for the future tax consequences
attributable to undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries. However, there may be a cost to repatriate the undistributed earnings of
certain of our international subsidiaries to us, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain international jurisdictions and
U.S. state income taxes. As of December 31, 2019, the cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries that is considered permanently","The total deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2020, were $1,844 million."

As described in “Tax Reform” below, one of the most significant changes in Tax Reform was the shift from a worldwide system of taxation to a
hybrid territorial system. The shift to a hybrid territorial system allows us to distribute cash via a dividend from our international subsidiaries
with a full dividend received deduction in the U.S. As a result, we will not recognize U.S. federal deferred taxes for the future tax consequences
attributable to undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries. However, there may be a cost to repatriate the undistributed earnings of
certain of our international subsidiaries to us, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain international jurisdictions and
U.S. state income taxes. As of December 31, 2019, the cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries that is considered permanently","The net deferred income tax liabilities were $5,103 million as of December 31, 2020."

Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform) was enacted, which resulted in significant changes to the Code and
was effective beginning on January 1, 2018. The most significant changes affecting us are as follows:
•reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent;
•assessment of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits from our international subsidiaries;
•shift from a worldwide system of taxation to a hybrid territorial system of taxation, resulting in a minimum tax on the income of
international subsidiaries (the GILTI tax) rather than a tax deferral on such earnings in certain circumstances;
•deduction for all of the costs to acquire or construct certain business assets in the year they are placed in service through 2022; and
•repeal of the manufacturing deduction;
The following narrative describes the activity that occurred with respect to Tax Reform for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018.
We reflected an overall income tax benefit of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 with respect to Tax Reform as a result of the
following:
•We remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using the 21 percent rate, which resulted in a tax benefit and a reduction to
our net deferred tax liabilities of $2.6 billion.
•We recognized a one-time transition tax of $734 million on the deemed repatriation of previously undistributed accumulated earnings
and profits of our international subsidiaries based on approximately $4.7 billion of the combined earnings and profits of our
international subsidiaries that had not been distributed to us. This transition tax will be remitted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
over the eight-year period provided in the Code, with the first annual remittance paid in 2018.","As of December 31, 2019, Valero Energy Corporation had its California tax returns for 2004 through 2008 and 2011 through 2016 under audit by the state of California."

the proposed adjustments by the CRA for 2013 and 2014 and we do not expect the ultimate disposition of these adjustments will result in a

Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform) was enacted, which resulted in significant changes to the Code and
was effective beginning on January 1, 2018. The most significant changes affecting us are as follows:
•reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent;
•assessment of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits from our international subsidiaries;
•shift from a worldwide system of taxation to a hybrid territorial system of taxation, resulting in a minimum tax on the income of
international subsidiaries (the GILTI tax) rather than a tax deferral on such earnings in certain circumstances;
•deduction for all of the costs to acquire or construct certain business assets in the year they are placed in service through 2022; and
•repeal of the manufacturing deduction;
The following narrative describes the activity that occurred with respect to Tax Reform for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018.
We reflected an overall income tax benefit of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 with respect to Tax Reform as a result of the
following:
•We remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using the 21 percent rate, which resulted in a tax benefit and a reduction to
our net deferred tax liabilities of $2.6 billion.
•We recognized a one-time transition tax of $734 million on the deemed repatriation of previously undistributed accumulated earnings
and profits of our international subsidiaries based on approximately $4.7 billion of the combined earnings and profits of our
international subsidiaries that had not been distributed to us. This transition tax will be remitted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
over the eight-year period provided in the Code, with the first annual remittance paid in 2018.","Valero Energy Corporation reflected an overall income tax benefit of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to Tax Reform. This benefit was derived from various factors, including the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new tax rate of 21 percent, resulting in a net reduction of $2.6 billion in net deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, Valero recognized a one-time transition tax of $734 million on the deemed repatriation of previously undistributed accumulated earnings and profits of its international subsidiaries."
How did Tax Reform impact Valero Energy Corporation's financial position and results of operations?,"U.S. State
As of December 31, 2019, our California tax returns for 2004 through 2008 and 2011 through 2016 were under audit by the state of California.
We do not expect the ultimate disposition of these audits will result in a material change to our financial position, results of operations, or
liquidity. We believe these audits will be resolved for amounts consistent with the liability for unrecognized tax benefits associated with these
audits.

Segment Information
Effective January 1, 2019, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages
and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of the growing
importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production. The renewable diesel segment
includes the operations of DGD, which were transferred from the refining segment on January 1, 2019. Also effective January 1, 2019, we no
longer have a VLP segment, and we include the operations of VLP in our refining segment. This change was made because of the Merger
Transaction with VLP, as described in Note 2, and the resulting change in how we manage VLP’s operations. We no longer manage VLP as a
business but as logistics assets that support the operations of our refining segment. Our prior period segment information has been
retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation.
We have three reportable segments — refining, ethanol, and renewable diesel. Each segment is a strategic business unit that offers different
products and services by employing unique technologies and marketing strategies and whose operations and operating performance are
managed and evaluated separately. Operating performance is measured based on the operating income generated by the segment, which
includes revenues and expenses that are directly attributable to the management of the respective segment. Intersegment sales are generally
derived from transactions made at prevailing market rates. The following is a description of each segment’s business operations.
•The refining segment includes the operations of our 15 petroleum refineries, the associated marketing activities, and logistics assets that
support our refining operations. The principal products manufactured by our refineries and sold by this segment include gasolines and
blendstocks, distillates, and other products.

General
U.S. GAAP requires or permits certain assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis in our balance
sheets, and those assets and liabilities are presented below under “Recurring Fair Value Measurements” and “Nonrecurring Fair Value
Measurements.” Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, such as derivative financial instruments, are measured at fair
value at the end of each reporting period. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as the impairment of
property, plant and equipment, are measured at fair value in particular circumstances.
U.S. GAAP also requires the disclosure of the fair values of financial instruments when an option to elect fair value accounting has been
provided, but such election has not been made. A debt obligation is an example of such a financial instrument. The disclosure of the fair values
of financial instruments not recognized at fair value in our balance sheet is presented below under “Other Financial Instruments.”

U.S. GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation
techniques based on the degree to which objective prices in external active markets are available to measure fair value. Following is a
description of each of the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
•Level 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active.
•Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about what market participants
would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which
might include occasional market quotes or sales of similar instruments or our own financial data such as internally developed pricing
models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant
judgment.

Can you provide examples of observable and unobservable inputs within the fair value hierarchy?,"of financial instruments not recognized at fair value in our balance sheet is presented below under “Other Financial Instruments.”
U.S. GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation
techniques based on the degree to which objective prices in external active markets are available to measure fair value. Following is a
description of each of the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
•Level 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active.
•Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about what market participants
would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which
might include occasional market quotes or sales of similar instruments or our own financial data such as internally developed pricing
models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant
judgment.
