production in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, where we are progressing new liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. 
Our successes in Upstream development were 
recognized in 2018 by the World Oil and Gas Council, when they honored ExxonMobil as “Explorer of the Year” – for the second consecutive year. 
In our Downstream business, we progressed six major 
refining investments, all of which are advantaged versus industry. Three started up last year, including the Beaumont hydrofiner, the Antwerp delayed coker, and the Rotterdam advanced hydrocracker. These Downstream investments deliver higher-value products and are expected to generate 20-percent returns.In our Chemical business, we moved forward on 13 new facilities to meet growing demand. Seven of these came online by the end of last year. The remaining six are on schedule. These investments, enhanced by our technologies and global supply chain, are expected to support 30-percent sales growth by 2025.
Across all of our operations, we are committed to 
maintaining a safe work environment enriched by diversity and characterized by open communications and trust. We strive to continuously improve and achieve the highest standards of excellence in all that we do.
This includes upholding the highest standards of 
corporate citizenship. We maintain high ethical standards, obey all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and respect local and national cultures. 
We are also dedicated to reducing environmental",These investments in ExxonMobil's Downstream business are expected to generate 20-percent returns.

In the Chemical business, we have started up seven new 
facilities since 2017 and are planning the completion of another six projects by 2025, supported by growing demand for high-performance chemical products. The Singapore butyl plant, the Newport elastomer plant expansion, and the Baytown ethane cracker all started up in 2018. We are also progressing additional investments in the United States and Singapore. These new facilities will result in a 40-percent increase in manufacturing capacity in North America and Asia.sites will connect to the data lake by 2020. By applying advanced analytics to this abundance of data, we can identify new approaches to run sites more efficiently and potentially with fewer emissions. 
We also have the largest inventory of operated horizontal 
wells in the United States at more than 6,600, providing our engineering and subsurface experts with one of the most extensive databases in the industry with which to learn and optimize development and operating plans. 
To fully leverage the tremendous amount of data we 
have and the scale advantage it provides, we deploy a network of technology centers around the world, staffed with scientists and engineers who collaborate globally with manufacturing sites, production units, projects, and ventures across the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical business lines. Enabled by access to global data, these engineers drive manufacturing excellence by monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing process units and equipment fleets around the world. Our technology centers are seamless extensions of our production and manufacturing sites, providing valuable technical solutions that we replicate across our global network. Best practices across similar assets are quickly and broadly applied, which leads to effective prioritization and efficient execution of high-value optimization opportunities. Equipment monitoring and process analysis enable global manufacturing circuit optimization efforts and are anticipated to generate more than $500 million in cumulative earnings contribution in our Downstream business between 2017 and 2020.","ExxonMobil completed three projects in 2018 to increase production of higher-value products.

By applying advanced analytics to this abundance of data, we can identify new approaches to run sites more efficiently and potentially with fewer emissions. 
We also have the largest inventory of operated horizontal 
wells in the United States at more than 6,600, providing our engineering and subsurface experts with one of the most extensive databases in the industry with which to learn and optimize development and operating plans. 
To fully leverage the tremendous amount of data we 
have and the scale advantage it provides, we deploy a network of technology centers around the world, staffed with scientists and engineers who collaborate globally with manufacturing sites, production units, projects, and ventures across the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical business lines. Enabled by access to global data, these engineers drive manufacturing excellence by monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing process units and equipment fleets around the world. Our technology centers are seamless extensions of our production and manufacturing sites, providing valuable technical solutions that we replicate across our global network. Best practices across similar assets are quickly and broadly applied, which leads to effective prioritization and efficient execution of high-value optimization opportunities. Equipment monitoring and process analysis enable global manufacturing circuit optimization efforts and are anticipated to generate more than $500 million in cumulative earnings contribution in our Downstream business between 2017 and 2020.",Equipment monitoring and process analysis efforts in ExxonMobil's Downstream business are anticipated to generate more than $500 million in cumulative earnings contribution between 2017 and 2020.

to respond to market dynamics, enabling maximum value capture. In the Permian, we leveraged excess pipeline takeaway capacity and terminal assets to transport crude efficiently – including both equity- and third-party crude – to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Capturing these market opportunities across the value chain resulted in an estimated $1 billion benefit in 2018. As Permian crude production grows, we continue to expand our logistics footprint beyond the level of equity production to retain this advantage and create feed flexibility for our global refining and chemical assets. We maximize value across the entire value chain, ensuring the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The different sectors we serve and products we make provide further diversification, helping to mitigate the impact of commodity price cycles. Our integrated business provides additional scale, allows us to share support organizations and facility infrastructure, and capture synergies in organizational capabilities and competencies.
NORTH AMERICA INTEGRATION
An excellent example of the value of integration involves our North American operations, where our Upstream business produces oil and natural gas in the Permian and other basins. Permian crude volumes are transported via integrated midstream assets to refineries and chemical complexes along the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Midwest, where they are upgraded to higher-value fuels and products for global markets. We also create value by processing high-quality Permian crudes at manufacturing locations in Europe and Asia, including our Singapore steam cracker.
By maximizing integration across the entire value chain, 
we capture incremental value at transfer points or when short-term market disconnects occur.

SUPERIOR PROJECT EXECUTION
A rigorous approach to project development, supported by decades of large-scale project experience across multiple geographies and resource types, is enabling key developments like Guyana, where the pace of project execution is outperforming industry averages.We apply project learnings and experience in the Upstream to the Downstream and Chemical business lines as well. For example, Upstream project development expertise is facilitating modular development of a future petrochemical complex in San Patricio, Texas, in the United States. Modular development – a common practice in Upstream projects – involves constructing equipment off-site at a lower cost, and then transporting it to the site fully built. We also successfully utilized this practice in the construction of the Antwerp delayed coker and the Rotterdam advanced hydrocracker. This process of modular development improves project execution efficiency and lowers costs by sourcing construction globally. 
We aggressively identify efficiencies and cost reductions during project design and development, such as the implementation of facility-related optimizations that reduce plant complexity. In Downstream and Chemical projects, these efforts delivered significant value in 2018, with more than $1 billion in savings via design and execution optimization. For example, an integrated team with personnel from our Chemical, research and development, and procurement organizations partnered to design a control center for a grassroots plant in Baytown. Visibility into strategic supplier offerings allowed the cross-functional team to identify an alternative approach by using a modular designed control center, which resulted in a cost-competitive alternative to the traditional stick-built design, with savings of 50 percent. This concept establishes a benchmark going forward, resulting in a step-change in new control center construction design.FUNCTIONAL EXCELLENCE:  PROJECT

28EXXONMOBIL  2018 SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORTBUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS
Demand for oil is expected to increase approximately 20 percent from 2016 to 2040 and will remain the primary 
source of energy for commercial transportation and continue to serve as a critical feedstock for chemical products. Natural gas demand is expected to grow nearly 40 percent over the same period, largely from expanding industrial activity and increasing use in power generation as utilities look to switch to lower-emission fuels.
To meet this demand and offset natural decline rates of approximately 5 to 7 percent per year, increased supplies, requiring significant investment, for both oil and natural gas are needed. We also expect global liquefied natural gas (LNG) volumes to more than double by 2040, primarily to supply Asian and European markets. 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
Proprietary exploration technologies  were key to the discovery of more than 5 billion barrels of resource in 
Guyana across 10 discoveries through 2018. Guyana is one of the most significant play openings across the industry in recent years. These discoveries are enabling us to rapidly build a portfolio of deepwater projects that will leverage our leading project-development expertise.

28EXXONMOBIL  2018 SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORTBUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS
Demand for oil is expected to increase approximately 20 percent from 2016 to 2040 and will remain the primary 
source of energy for commercial transportation and continue to serve as a critical feedstock for chemical products. Natural gas demand is expected to grow nearly 40 percent over the same period, largely from expanding industrial activity and increasing use in power generation as utilities look to switch to lower-emission fuels.
To meet this demand and offset natural decline rates of approximately 5 to 7 percent per year, increased supplies, requiring significant investment, for both oil and natural gas are needed. We also expect global liquefied natural gas (LNG) volumes to more than double by 2040, primarily to supply Asian and European markets. 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
Proprietary exploration technologies  were key to the discovery of more than 5 billion barrels of resource in 
Guyana across 10 discoveries through 2018. Guyana is one of the most significant play openings across the industry in recent years. These discoveries are enabling us to rapidly build a portfolio of deepwater projects that will leverage our leading project-development expertise.
We leveraged scale  and financial capacity to aggressively bid for attractive acreage in Brazil, acquiring more 
acreage than any other major international oil company in recent years. We now possess a high-quality portfolio 
of deepwater development and exploration opportuniti es in Brazil with multibillion-barrel potential.
The combined fundamentals of low-cost development, an integrated business model , and a continued focus 
on technology are allowing us to maximize value from the Permian. We are positioned to deliver decades of low-cost, highly profitable production that will move through an efficient logistics network and serve as advantaged feedstock for U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and chemical plants.
We demonstrate functional excellence  with leading technical and commercial capabilities that are critical to 
developing some of industry’s lowest-cost LNG supplies in the frontier countries of Papua New Guinea and","ExxonMobil operates in a highly complex, competitive, and changing global energy business environment.

Global demand for fuels and lubricant products is directly linked to economic activity. Fuel demand  
for commercial transportation is expected to increase over the next two decades, driven by diesel and jet fuel,  
while worldwide gasoline demand will likely peak and then begin declining with increasing fuel efficiency and 
electric vehicle penetration.
Finished lubricant demand is expected to grow, with high-value synthetic lubricants significantly outpacing 
industry growth. Demand for higher-value grades of lube basestocks will grow by approximately 30 percent by 2025, as consumer preferences for higher-performing finished lubricants products increase.
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

30EXXONMOBIL  2018 SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORTBUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS
Global demand for fuels and lubricant products is directly linked to economic activity. Fuel demand  
for commercial transportation is expected to increase over the next two decades, driven by diesel and jet fuel,  
while worldwide gasoline demand will likely peak and then begin declining with increasing fuel efficiency and 
electric vehicle penetration.
Finished lubricant demand is expected to grow, with high-value synthetic lubricants significantly outpacing 
industry growth. Demand for higher-value grades of lube basestocks will grow by approximately 30 percent by 2025, as consumer preferences for higher-performing finished lubricants products increase.

33CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY
ExxonMobil’s primary responsibility is to produce 
the energy and products that are essential to modern life and economic development. What we do is critically important. And it is equally important that we operate 
in a way that protects people, the 
environment, and the well-being of communities  
where we live and work.
Our annual Sustainability Report delivers a comprehensive analysis of the critical dimensions  
of sustainability, including environmental, social,  
and governance (ESG) performance. The following  
is a summary of our approach.
ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Management of environmental performance is guided by a fundamental scientific understanding of the impacts of energy and petrochemical production and a commitment to develop, maintain, and operate facilities using appropriate environmental standards. 
One area of critical importance is climate change. 
We manage the risks by reducing our emissions, helping consumers reduce theirs, participating in policy discussions, and advancing research to find new low-emissions technologies. 
For example, in 2018, we outlined measures to reduce 
methane emissions by 15 percent and flaring by 
25 percent by 2020. We also continued to advance our 
research into next-generation, breakthrough energy solutions, including biofuels, carbon capture and storage, and technology to lower the energy intensity of industrial processes. Since 2000, we have invested more than  
$9 billion in lower-emission energy solutions. 
On the policy front, ExxonMobil supports the Paris 
Agreement and market-based approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as a revenue-neutral carbon tax. 
Our 2019 Energy & Carbon Summary  provides a 
detailed overview of how the company manages risks","ExxonMobil's key sustainability initiatives focus on reducing emissions, developing low-emission energy solutions, and supporting market-based approaches to combat climate change. The company outlines measures to reduce methane emissions and flaring, invests in lower-emission energy solutions, and supports policies like the Paris Agreement and revenue-neutral carbon tax."
"How does ExxonMobil address the risks associated with climate change, and what measures has the company taken to reduce its environmental impact?","across Downstream and Chemical operations by interconnecting pipelines and optimizing logistics. We are 
also jointly developing the Singapore residual upgrade project between Downstream and Chemical to upgrade residual, low-value streams from both chemical and downstream operations into Group II lube basestocks, further improving the competitiveness of the site.

and governance (ESG) performance. The following  
is a summary of our approach.
ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Management of environmental performance is guided by a fundamental scientific understanding of the impacts of energy and petrochemical production and a commitment to develop, maintain, and operate facilities using appropriate environmental standards. 
One area of critical importance is climate change. 
We manage the risks by reducing our emissions, helping consumers reduce theirs, participating in policy discussions, and advancing research to find new low-emissions technologies. 
For example, in 2018, we outlined measures to reduce 
methane emissions by 15 percent and flaring by 
25 percent by 2020. We also continued to advance our 
research into next-generation, breakthrough energy solutions, including biofuels, carbon capture and storage, and technology to lower the energy intensity of industrial processes. Since 2000, we have invested more than  
$9 billion in lower-emission energy solutions. 
On the policy front, ExxonMobil supports the Paris 
Agreement and market-based approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as a revenue-neutral carbon tax. 
Our 2019 Energy & Carbon Summary  provides a 
detailed overview of how the company manages risks","ExxonMobil addresses climate change risks by reducing emissions, advancing research for low-emission technologies, and supporting policies like the Paris Agreement and revenue-neutral carbon tax. The company has outlined goals to reduce methane emissions and flaring, and has invested billions in lower-emission energy solutions. These measures contribute to reducing the company's environmental impact and demonstrate its commitment to addressing climate change risks."
What is ExxonMobil's approach to managing environmental performance?,"across Downstream and Chemical operations by interconnecting pipelines and optimizing logistics. We are 
also jointly developing the Singapore residual upgrade project between Downstream and Chemical to upgrade residual, low-value streams from both chemical and downstream operations into Group II lube basestocks, further improving the competitiveness of the site. 
Leading project management capabilities and deep technical and commercial functional excellence  have 
contributed to recent sales growth. With a proven track record of delivering several major chemical projects 
successfully in the past two years, we remain a partner of choice, as demonstrated by the world-scale petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with partner SABIC and the agreement of cooperation signed with the government of Guangdong Province, China, for a potential petrochemical facility.
Critical positions in the Chemical business are filled by employees we have developed through training, challenging 
assignments, and broad experiences. Approximately 1,500 people  fill these roles and are essential to meeting 
resource demand for major growth projects.
33CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY
ExxonMobil’s primary responsibility is to produce 
the energy and products that are essential to modern life and economic development. What we do is critically important. And it is equally important that we operate 
in a way that protects people, the 
environment, and the well-being of communities  
where we live and work.

SOCIAL
We work to ensure sustainable economic benefits for communities where we operate. We focus on three key areas: employing and training a local workforce; supporting diverse, local suppliers; and improving people’s livelihoods through direct community investments. 
For example, around the world, our affiliates are locally 
staffed, including in Nigeria, Chad, and Indonesia, where we have 95 percent local hires, including 90 percent of supervisors and managers. 
In Papua New Guinea, where it has been nearly a  
decade since construction started on our liquefied 
natural gas project, investment in local businesses continues to grow. In fact, we have spent about 
$4 billion on local goods and services.And in a more recently sanctioned project in Guyana, we have already worked with more than 500 Guyanese-owned companies to support capacity-building in the country ahead of first oil production in 2020. As part of our long-term commitment to support local development priorities, we invested $10 million in a collaboration with Conservation International and the University of Guyana to train Guyanese for sustainable job opportunities and  
to expand community-supported conservation.
GOVERNANCE
Our corporate governance systems and practices are core strengths of ExxonMobil. We apply a rigorous approach to corporate governance in all aspects of the way we do business, everywhere we operate, and we observe the highest standards of integrity and ethics.
ExxonMobil requires that employees, officers, directors, and those working on our behalf comply with all applicable laws, including U.S. anti-corruption, anti-trust, anti-boycott, trade sanctions, and export controls laws, as well as laws in other countries applicable to our business. 
Good corporate governance creates a business environment that supports long-term growth. ExxonMobil’s Board of Directors – comprised of the CEO and nine independent directors – provides a key oversight role, including review of risk management efforts and strategic plans. Ensuring that we have diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and thought represented on  
the board remains critical to our success.

Revenue is recognized at the amount the Corporation expects","Exxon Mobil Corporation's accounting and financial reporting practices reflect its integrated business model and conform to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Corporation's financial statements include the accounts of its subsidiaries and its share of the undivided interest in certain Upstream assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. The preparation of these statements involves management making estimates and judgments that impact the reported amounts. Revenue recognition is based on the Corporation's expectations, and the functional currency for translating accounts varies depending on the operation's location."
What is the Corporation's functional currency for translating accounts outside the United States?,"The “functional currency” for translating the accounts of the 
majority of Downstream and Chemical operations outside the United States is the local currency. The local currency is also used for Upstream operations that are relatively self-contained and integrated within a particular country. The U.S. dollar is used for operations in countries with a history of high inflation and certain other countries.
Revenue is recognized at the amount the Corporation expects 
to receive when the customer has taken control, which is typically when title transfers and the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership.
Inventories of crude oil, products, and merchandise are 
carried at the lower of current market value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method – LIFO). Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.
The Corporation makes use of derivative instruments. When 
derivatives are used, they are recorded at fair value, and gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognized in earnings.
The Corporation’s exploration and production activities 
are accounted for under the “successful efforts” method. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line method. Unit-of-production rates are based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil, natural gas, and other minerals that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities. The straight-line method is based on estimated asset service life.
The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain 
assets at the time they are installed. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis and are accreted over time for the change in their present value. The costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated. Liabilities for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
The Corporation recognizes the underfunded or overfunded 
status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a liability or asset in the balance sheet with the offset in equity, net of deferred taxes.
A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil 
and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits and tax disputes. For further information on litigation and tax contingencies, see Notes 16 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in ExxonMobil’s 2018 Financial Statements and Supplemental Information booklet.
The Corporation awards stock-based compensation to 
employees in the form of restricted stock units. Compensation expense is measured by the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service period.

How is Total Shareholder Return (TSR) calculated and what does it measure?,"Total shareholder return (TSR) • Measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a 
specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. We calculate shareholder return over a particular measurement period by: dividing (1) the sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock price at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the beginning of the measurement period. For this purpose, we assume dividends are reinvested in stock at market prices at approximately the same time actual dividends are paid. Shareholder return is usually quoted on an annualized basis.
Capital and exploration expenditures (Capex) •  Represents the combined total of additions at 
cost to property, plant and equipment, and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the 
Summary statement of income. ExxonMobil’s Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges (effective 2013), the value of ExxonMobil shares used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil’s management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.
Returns, investment returns, project returns • Unless referring specifically to ROCE, references 
to returns, investment returns, project returns and similar terms mean discounted cash flow returns based on current company estimates. Future investment returns exclude prior exploration and acquisition costs. 
Proved reserves • Proved reserve figures in this publication are determined in accordance with 
SEC definitions in effect at the end of each applicable year. In statements covering reserve 
replacement for years prior to 2009, reserves include oil sands and equity company reserves, which at the time were excluded from SEC reserves.
Proved reserves replacement ratio •  The reserves replacement ratio is calculated for a specified 
period utilizing the applicable proved oil-equivalent reserves additions divided by oil-equivalent 
production. See “Proved reserves” above.
Resources, resource base, and recoverable resources •  Along with similar terms used in this 
report, these refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are","Total shareholder return (TSR) is calculated by dividing the sum of the cumulative value of dividends received during a measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus the difference between the stock price at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period, by the stock price at the beginning of the measurement period.

replacement for years prior to 2009, reserves include oil sands and equity company reserves, which at the time were excluded from SEC reserves.
Proved reserves replacement ratio •  The reserves replacement ratio is calculated for a specified 
period utilizing the applicable proved oil-equivalent reserves additions divided by oil-equivalent 
production. See “Proved reserves” above.
Resources, resource base, and recoverable resources •  Along with similar terms used in this 
report, these refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are","ExxonMobil operates in a highly complex, competitive, and changing global energy business environment where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. This long-term orientation underpins the Corporation's philosophy on talent development. They recognize the importance of nurturing and developing talent that can thrive in this dynamic landscape and make valuable contributions to the corporation's long-term success."
How many regular employees did ExxonMobil have in 2021?,"Total shareholder return (TSR) • Measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a 
specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. We calculate shareholder return over a particular measurement period by: dividing (1) the sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock price at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the beginning of the measurement period. For this purpose, we assume dividends are reinvested in stock at market prices at approximately the same time actual dividends are paid. Shareholder return is usually quoted on an annualized basis.
Capital and exploration expenditures (Capex) •  Represents the combined total of additions at 
cost to property, plant and equipment, and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the 
Summary statement of income. ExxonMobil’s Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges (effective 2013), the value of ExxonMobil shares used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil’s management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.
Returns, investment returns, project returns • Unless referring specifically to ROCE, references 
to returns, investment returns, project returns and similar terms mean discounted cash flow returns based on current company estimates. Future investment returns exclude prior exploration and acquisition costs.
