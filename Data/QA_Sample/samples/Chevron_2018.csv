Business Environment and Outlook
Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina,
Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria,the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea,Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.
Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor
affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global marketsoutside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refinedproducts. It is the company’s objective to deliver competitive results and stockholder value in any business environment.Periods of sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause thecompany to adjust operating expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended toimprove financial performance.
The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due
to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lowertax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative ofexpected results in future periods.

Business Environment and Outlook
Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina,
Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria,the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea,Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.
Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor
affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global marketsoutside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refinedproducts. It is the company’s objective to deliver competitive results and stockholder value in any business environment.Periods of sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause thecompany to adjust operating expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended toimprove financial performance.
The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due
to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lowertax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative ofexpected results in future periods. Note 16 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years.

In the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in May 2015 as a result of
difficulties in securing work and equipment permits. Net oil-equivalent production in the Partitioned Zone in 2014 was81,000 barrels per day. During 2015, net oil-equivalent production averaged 28,000 barrels per day. As of early 2019,production remains shut in and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolutionbetween Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The financial effects from the loss of production in 2018 were not significant and are notexpected to be significant in 2019.
Chevron has interests in Venezuelan crude oil production assets operated by independent equity affiliates. During 2018, net
oil equivalent production in Venezuela averaged 44,000 barrels per day. The operating environment in Venezuela has beendeteriorating for some time. In January 2019, the United States government issued sanctions against the Venezuelan nationaloil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA), which is the company’s partner in the equity affiliates. The equityaffiliates continue to operate, and the company is conducting its business pursuant to general licenses issued coincident withthe new sanctions. Future events could result in the environment in Venezuela becoming more challenged, which could leadto increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial results.

U.S. Upstream
Millions of dollars 2018 2017 2016
Earnings $ 3,278 $ 3,640 $ (2,054)
U.S. upstream earnings were $3.28 billion in2018, compared with $3.64 billion in2017. The decrease inearnings was
primarily due to the absence of the 2017 benefit from U.S. tax reform of $3.33 billion, higher other tax items of $160 millionandhigher exploration expense of$350 million, partially offset byhigher crude oilrealizations of$2.45 billion andhigher
crude oil production of $1.12 billion.
U.S. upstream earnings were $3.64 billion in2017, compared with alossof$2.05 billion from 2016. Theimprovement in
earnings reflected a benefit of $3.33 billion from U.S. tax reform, higher crude oil and natural gas realizations of $1.3 billion
andlower depreciation expenses of$650 million, primarily reflecting adecrease inimpairments andother asset write-offs.

These laws and regulations govern the manner in which the company conducts its operations and the products it sells. Compliance with these laws and regulations is an important aspect of the company's operations and can affect its financial performance.

Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where pastoperations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative orremedial work or both to meet current standards.
Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide
environmental spending in 2018 at approximately $2.0 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditureswere approximately $0.5 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.5 billion of costs associated with theprevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites,and the abandonment and restoration of sites.
For 2019, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.5 billion. These capital costs are in addition

Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and
expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and
gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the futureunder existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developedand undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wellswith existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered fromnew wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required forrecompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include fieldperformance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs.
The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and
to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated FinancialStatements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
1. Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production
(UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOPbasis using total proved reserves. During 2018, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization(DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $14.8 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2018were 6.1 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOPcalculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOPDD&A in 2018 would have increased by approximately $800 million.
2. Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A
significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Provedreserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumesin the cash flow model.

Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and
expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and
gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the futureunder existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developedand undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wellswith existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered fromnew wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required forrecompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include fieldperformance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs.
The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and
to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated FinancialStatements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
1. Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production
(UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOPbasis using total proved reserves. During 2018, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization(DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $14.8 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2018were 6.1 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOPcalculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOPDD&A in 2018 would have increased by approximately $800 million.

When does the company perform impairment reviews for its assets?,"The company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the
carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and naturalgas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying valueof the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil or natural gas priceoutlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes innational, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development orproduction of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed morelikely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset orasset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group isdisposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision

For 2018, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent and a discount rate for service costs of","The estimation of the impact of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) on earnings involves several assumptions, including changes to some assumptions that would reduce estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, and unfavorable changes that would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 24 on page 88 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations."
What was the total pension expense for the company in 2018?,"For 2018, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent and a discount rate for service costs of
3.7 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 3.0 percent for U.S. pension plans. The actual return for 2018 wasnegative. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2018, actual asset returns averaged 7.9 percent for these plans. Additionally,with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for these plans equaled or exceeded6.75 percent during each year.
Total pension expense for 2018 was $1.1 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount
rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, whichaccounted for about 63 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2018by approximately $83 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pensionexpense for 2018 by approximately $271 million.
The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2018, was a net liability of approximately $3.9 billion. An increase
in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2018,the company used a discount rate of 4.2 percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of thesensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to thecompany’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation, wouldhave reduced the plan obligation by approximately $339 million, and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded statusfrom approximately $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion.

Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax
matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For
example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws,opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation aresubject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional informationon the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.
Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the
loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling,general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for incometax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e.,likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction.

An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities
is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions andthe wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

What are the three levels of fair value hierarchy used by the company to measure the fair value of assets or liabilities?,"Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the
affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the variousfactors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjustedquarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.
Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are
presented separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income
attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement ofIncome and Consolidated Statement of Equity.
Fair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value
of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for theasset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.
Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial
risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently
occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivativeinstruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not applyhedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’scommodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company mayenter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt.Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges.Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains andlosses reflected in income.

What method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets?,"The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In
general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line methodis generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets.
Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group
amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Otherincome.”
Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to
maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals arecapitalized.
Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at

included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated,using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the ConsolidatedStatement of Equity.
Revenue Recognition The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical
products as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which
typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within 30days of delivery. The company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performanceobligation, and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity isrecognized.
Revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the
customer. The company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discountsand allowances. Until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price included inrevenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome.
Discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain
multiple products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. Thecompany includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable insubsequent periods.
Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a
seller and a customer are presented on a net basis in “Taxes other than on income” on the Consolidated Statement of Income,on page 50. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another(including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “Purchased crude oil andproducts” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

On January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) 2016-15 and 2016-18, which requireretrospective adjustment of prior periods in the Statement of Cash Flows.
In addition to other requirements, ASU 2016-15 specifies new standards for the classification of distributions from equity
affiliates. In adopting these new standards, Chevron utilized the cumulative earnings approach to evaluate returns on andreturns of investment from equity affiliates. For the year ended 2017 and 2016, a total of $166 and $322, respectively, wasreclassified from “Distributions less than income from equity affiliates” to “Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales andreturns of investment.”
Adoption of ASU 2016-18 requires the inclusion of restricted cash and associated changes in restricted cash in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The impact of ASU 2016-18 is captured across several line items in the Statement ofCash Flows, including “Net decrease (increase) in operating working capital,” “Decrease (increase) in other deferredcharges,” and “Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment” with associated net changes captured inboth “Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities” and “Net Cash Used for Investing Activities.” The line item “Net sales(purchases) of other short-term investments” was removed in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2016-18.

Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In fourth quarter 2018, the company elected to early adopt ASU 2018-02,
which permits the reclassification of stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of U.S. taxreform. Accordingly, Chevron reclassified $562 from “Accumulated other comprehensive losses” to “Retained earnings”associated with the reduction of the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. In accordance with its accountingpolicy, the company releases stranded income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income in the period theunderlying activity ceases to exist. ASU 2018-02 allowed for the reclassification of stranded tax effects as a result of thechange in tax rates due to U.S. tax reform to be recorded upon adoption of the ASU, rather than at the actual date that theunderlying activity ceases to exist. For additional detail, refer to Note 2 beginning on page 58.

For lessees, it requires the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for operating leases with terms longer than 12 months. This increases transparency and provides more information about a company's leasing activities. Chevron adopted ASU 2016-02 in accordance with the requirements set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), with an effective date of January 1, 2019."
What is the effective date of ASU 2016-02 for the company?,"Leases (Topic 842) In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, which
became effective for the company January 1, 2019. The standard requires that lessees present right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The company plans to elect the package ofpractical expedients to not re-evaluate existing lease contracts or lease classifications and therefore will not make changes tothose leases already recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under ASC 840 until the leases are fully amortized,amended, or modified. In addition, the company will not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. The companyintends to apply the land easement practical expedient. Chevron plans to elect the practical expedient to not separatenon-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significantnon-lease (i.e., service) components in addition to the lease component. The company will reclassify some contracts,currently not classified as leases, as operating leases under the new standard.
The company completed accounting policy and disclosure updates and system implementation necessary to meet the
standard’s requirements. The company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material impact on finance leases,which are currently referred to as capital leases. The company estimates that the operating lease right-of-use assets and leaseliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are approximately $4 billion, as of January 1, 2019. The company expects theimplementation of the standard will have a minimal impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income and ConsolidatedStatement of Cash Flows.

(“the provincial court”), in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil
production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration andproduction operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the allegedenvironmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary ofTexaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as themajority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of theconsortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into aformal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by thegovernment in proportion to Texpet’s ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted athree-year remediation program at a cost of $40.

On August 30, 2018, the Tribunal issued its Phase Two award in favor of Chevron and Texpet. The Tribunal unanimously
held that the Ecuadorian judgment was procured through fraud, bribery and corruption and was based on claims that theRepublic of Ecuador had settled and released in the mid-1990s, concluding that the Ecuadorian judgment “violatesinternational public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” Specifically, theTribunal found that (i) the Republic of Ecuador breached its obligations under the 1995 and 1998 settlement agreementsreleasing Texpet and its affiliates from public environmental claims (the same claims on which the Ecuadorian judgment wasexclusively based) and (ii) the Republic of Ecuador committed a denial of justice under customary international law andunder the fair and equitable treatment provision of the BIT due to the fraud and corruption in the Lago Agrio litigation. TheTribunal also found that Texpet satisfied its environmental remediation obligations with a $40 remediation program and thatEcuador certified that Texpet had performed all of its obligations under its settlement agreement. Among other things, theTribunal ordered the Republic of Ecuador to: (a) take immediate steps to remove the status of enforceability from theEcuadorian judgment; (b) promptly advise in writing any State where the Lago Agrio plaintiffs may be seeking theenforcement or recognition of the Ecuadorian judgment of the Tribunal’s declarations, orders and awards; (c) take measuresto “wipe out all the consequences” of Ecuador’s “internationally wrongful acts in regard to the Ecuadorian judgment;” and(d) compensate Chevron for any injuries resulting from the Ecuadorian judgment.

Management’s Assessment The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron,
remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in
this case. Due to the defects associated with the Ecuadorian judgment, management does not believe the judgment has anyutility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environmentsurrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

The 2018 increase in income tax charge of $5,763, from a benefit of $48 in 2017 to a charge of $5,715 in 2018, is a result ofthe year-over-year increase in total income before income tax expense, which is primarily due to higher crude oil realizationsoffset by lower gains on asset sales in 2018 compared to 2017.

The company’s effective tax ratechanged from (0.5) percent in 2017 to 28 percent in 2018.

U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates forwhich no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $59,900 atDecember 31, 2018. This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It isnot practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earningsthat are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes onremittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.
Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position
only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be
allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accountingstandards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future taxreturn that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.

Employee Benefit PlansThe company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plansas required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States,all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. Thecompany does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws andregulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractivethan the company’s other investment alternatives.
The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as
life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees sharethe costs. For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retireemedical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an
asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The funded status of the company’s pension and OPEB plans for 2018 and 2017 follows:

Employee Benefit PlansThe company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plansas required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States,all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. Thecompany does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws andregulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractivethan the company’s other investment alternatives.
The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as
life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees sharethe costs. For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retireemedical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an
asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The funded status of the company’s pension and OPEB plans for 2018 and 2017 follows:

obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single
rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’splans and the yields on high-quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yieldcurve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2018were 4.2 percent for the main U.S. pension plan and 4.3 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for theseplans at the end of 2017 were 3.5 and 3.6 percent, respectively, while in 2016 they were 3.9 and 4.1 percent for these plans,respectively.
Other Benefit Assumptions Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2018, for
the main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.2 percent in 2019 and gradually decline to4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2017, the assumed health care cost-trend ratesstarted with 7.4 percent in 2018 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. A 1-percentage-point change inthe assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans:

The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yieldcurve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2018were 4.2 percent for the main U.S. pension plan and 4.3 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for theseplans at the end of 2017 were 3.5 and 3.6 percent, respectively, while in 2016 they were 3.9 and 4.1 percent for these plans,respectively.
Other Benefit Assumptions Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2018, for
the main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.2 percent in 2019 and gradually decline to4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2017, the assumed health care cost-trend ratesstarted with 7.4 percent in 2018 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. A 1-percentage-point change inthe assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans:
1 Percent Increase 1 Percent Decrease
Effect on total service and interest cost components $ 12 $ (10)
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 197 $ (156)

The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of
risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequateliquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management.
The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 91 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans
have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assessthe plans’ investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.
For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company’s Investment Committee has established the following approved asset
allocation ranges: Equities 30–60 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 20–65 percent, Real Estate 0–15 percent, and AlternativeInvestments 0–15 percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following assetallocation guidelines: Equities 25–45 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 40–75 percent, and Real Estate 5–15 percent. Theother significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that varyby plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions andilliquidity constraints. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with activeinvestment managers and passive index funds.
The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2018, the company contributed $803 and $232 to its U.S. and international
pension plans, respectively. In 2019, the company expects contributions to be approximately $700 to its U.S. plans and $200
to its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pensionobligations, regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors.

some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2018, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will
sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay suchbenefits.

Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit
plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, trust assetsof $34 and $35, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.
Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links
awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were
$1,048, $936 and $662 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Other Contingencies and Commitments
Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject
to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period forwhich income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 16, beginning on page 74, for a discussion of the periods for whichtax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of thedifferences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to betaken in a tax return.
Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not
expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion ofmanagement, adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination.
Guarantees The company has two guarantees to equity affiliates totaling $968. Of this amount, $637 is associated with a
financing arrangement with an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 3-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum
amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate. The remaining amount of $331 is associated with certainpayments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 9-year remaining term ofthis guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerouscross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee.Chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee.
Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain
environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Underthe indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when theindemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen priorto the sale of the assets in 1997.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay
Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional
purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drillships, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregateapproximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2019 – $1,300; 2020 – $1,200; 2021 –$1,300; 2022 – $1,000; 2023 – $800; 2023 and after – $4,700. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be sharedwith project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $1,400 in 2018, $1,300 in 2017 and $1,300in 2016.

Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal
proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the
company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleumsubstances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closedand divested sites, including, but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries,chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining sites.

likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities.

Asset Retirement Obligations
The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liabilitywhen there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can bereasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertaintymay exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty aboutthe timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists toreasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset,(2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liabilityestimates and discount rates.
AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated
with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates forthe asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews ofits downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirementobligation.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2018, 2017 and 2016:
2018 2017 2016
Balance at January 1 $ 14,214 $ 14,243 $ 15,642

Revisions in estimated cash flows (84) 340 (694)
Balance at December 31 $ 14,050 $ 14,214 $ 14,243
In the table above, the amount associated with “Revisions in estimated cash flows” in 2018 reflects decreased cost estimates
to abandon wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the $14,050 balance at the end of 2018 was $12,957.

and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims,individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses infuture periods.
The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange,
acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability.These activities, individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.

Asset Retirement Obligations
The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liabilitywhen there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can bereasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertaintymay exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty aboutthe timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists toreasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset,(2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liabilityestimates and discount rates.
AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated
with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates forthe asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews ofits downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirementobligation.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2018, 2017 and 2016:

RevenueOn January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , and its related
amendments using the modified retrospective transition method, which did not require the restatement of prior periods. Theadoption did not result in a material change in the company’s accounting or have a material effect on the company’s financialposition, including the measurement of revenue, the timing of revenue recognition and the recognition of contract assets,liabilities and related costs.
The most significant change is the presentation of excise, value-added and similar taxes collected on behalf of third parties,
which are no longer presented within “Sales and other operating revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income startingin 2018. These taxes, which totaled $7,861 in 2018, are now netted in “Taxes other than on income” on the ConsolidatedStatement of Income. This change to presentation had no impact on earnings. These taxes totaled $7,189 and $6,905 in 2017and 2016, respectively.
The company applied the optional exemption to not report any unfulfilled performance obligations related to contracts that
have terms of less than one year. The amount of future revenue for unfulfilled performance obligations under long-termcontracts with fixed components was insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Revenue from contracts with customers is presented in “Sales and other operating revenue” along with some activity that is
accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606, which is not material to this line, on the Consolidated Statement of Income.Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (includingbuy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “purchased crude oil and products” on theConsolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 13 beginning on page 66 for additional information on the company’ssegmentation of revenue.
Receivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $9,779 and$10,046 at January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members areknowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reservesestimates.
The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to
estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates andchanges; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes arecalculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Chevron Corporation
Reserves Manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon
reserves.
During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and
discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’ssenior leadership team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserveactivity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews,those matters would also be discussed with the Board.

graduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and
resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gasreserves processes. He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and isan active member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists andthe Society of Petroleum Engineers.
All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves
estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members areknowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reservesestimates.
The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to
estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates andchanges; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes arecalculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Chevron Corporation
Reserves Manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon
reserves.
During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and
discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’ssenior leadership team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserveactivity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews,those matters would also be discussed with the Board.
RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities.
These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with theChevron Corporation Reserves Manual.
Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2018, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based
on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line","Chevron Corporation utilizes a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies to establish proved reserves additions. These technologies include information generated from wells, such as well logs and wireline data. Advanced geophysical measurements, data analysis, and reservoir modeling techniques are also employed. By leveraging these technologies, Chevron Corporation ensures accurate assessment and classification of proved reserves, enhancing the company's decision-making process and resource management."

Revisions In 2016, development activities primarily at Wheatstone were responsible for the 853 BCF increase in Australia.
Net revisions of 443 BCF in Asia were primarily due to improved field performance in China and Thailand.In 2017, reservoir performance and new seismic data in the greater Gorgon area were primarily responsible for the 1.5 TCF
increase in Australia. Improved performance in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 670BCF increase in the United States. The Sonam Field in Nigeria was primarily responsible for the 184 BCF increase in Africa.
In 2018, reservoir performance, well test and surveillance data at Wheatstone and the greater Gorgon area were responsible
for the 1.0 TCF increase in Australia. The Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh and the Pattani Field in Thailand were primarilyresponsible for the 347 BCF increase in Asia. Improved performance in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarilyresponsible for the 258 BCF increase in the United States.

The Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh and the Pattani Field in Thailand led to a 347 BCF increase in Asia. Improved performance in the Midland and Delaware basins resulted in a 258 BCF increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries also played a significant role, with 388 BCF of extensions and discoveries in the United States in 2016, 1.4 TCF in 2017, and 1.6 TCF in 2018."

Liquefied natural gas  (LNG) Natural gas that is 
liquefied under extremely cold temperatures to 
facilitate storage or transportation in specially designed vessels.
Natural gas liquids (NGLs) Separated from natural 
gas, these include ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline.
Oil-equivalent gas (OEG) The volume of natural gas 
needed to generate the equivalent amount of heat as a barrel of crude oil. Approximately 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of crude oil.
Oil sands  Naturally occurring mixture of bitumen  
(a heavy, viscous form of crude oil), water, sand and 
c
lay. Using hydroprocessing technology, bitumen can 
be refined to yield synthetic oil.Petrochemicals  Compounds derived from 
petroleum. These include aromatics, which are used to make plastics, adhesives, synthetic fibers and household detergents; and olefins, which are used to make packaging, plastic pipes, tires, batteries, household detergents and synthetic motor oils.
Production  Total production  refers to all the crude 
oil (including synthetic oil), NGLs and natural gas 
produced from a property. Net production  is the 
company’s share of total production after deducting both royalties paid to landowners and a government’s agreed-upon share of production under a PSC. Liquids production  refers to crude oil, condensate, 
NGLs and synthetic oil volumes. Oil-equivalent production is the sum of the barrels of liquids  and the 
oil-equivalent barrels of natural gas produced. See barrels of oil-equivalent and  oil-equivalent gas .
Production-sharing contract  (PSC) An agreement","Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled to a very low temperature, around -160 degrees Celsius, which transforms it into a liquid state. LNG is used for storage and transportation purposes, as it occupies around 1/600th the volume of natural gas in its gaseous state. This makes it more practical to transport over long distances, especially by sea. LNG is a vital component of the global natural gas trade and helps meet the growing demand for cleaner-burning fossil fuels."

NGLs and synthetic oil volumes. Oil-equivalent production is the sum of the barrels of liquids  and the 
oil-equivalent barrels of natural gas produced. See barrels of oil-equivalent and  oil-equivalent gas .
Production-sharing contract  (PSC) An agreement 
between a government and a contractor (generally an oil and gas company) whereby production is shared between the parties in a prearranged manner. The contractor typically incurs all exploration, development and production costs, which are subsequently recoverable out of an agreed-upon share of any future PSC production, referred to as cost recovery oil and/or gas. Any remaining production, referred to as profit oil and/or gas, is shared between the parties on an agreed-upon basis as stipulated in the PSC. The government may also retain a share of PSC production as a royalty payment, and the contractor typically owes income tax on its portion of the profit oil and/or gas. The contractor’s share of PSC oil and/or gas production and reserves varies over time, as it is dependent on prices, costs and specific PSC terms.
Reserves Crude oil and natural gas contained in 
underground rock formations called reservoirs 
and saleable hydrocarbons extracted from oil sands, shale, coalbeds and other nonrenewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas. Net proved reserves  are 
the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations and exclude royalties and interests owned by others. Estimates change as additional information becomes available. Oil-equivalent 
reserves  are the sum of the liquids reserves and 
the oil-equivalent gas reserves. See barrels of oil-equivalent  and oil-equivalent gas . The company 
discloses only net proved reserves in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors should refer to proved reserves disclosures in Chevron’s Annual Report on Form 10-K  for the year 
ended December 31, 2018.
Resources  Estimated quantities of oil and gas 
resources are recorded under Chevron’s 6P system, 
which is modeled after the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ Petroleum Resource Management System, and include quantities classified as proved, probable and possible reserves, plus those that remain contingent on commerciality. Unrisked resources, unrisked resource base  and similar terms represent 
the arithmetic sum of the amounts recorded under each of these classifications. Recoverable resources, potentially recoverable volumes  and","A production-sharing contract (PSC) is an agreement between a government and an oil and gas company. Under the PSC, both parties share the production of oil and gas in a prearranged manner. The contractor, usually the oil and gas company, bears the costs of exploration, development, and production. These costs are recoverable from the agreed-upon share of future production, known as cost recovery oil and/or gas. The remaining production, known as profit oil and/or gas, is shared between the government and the contractor as per the terms of the PSC. The government may also retain a share of the production as a royalty payment, and the contractor is liable for income tax on its portion of the profit oil and/or gas.
