As a company that touches the lives of billions of people 
around the world and provides the necessities of modern life, our responsibilities are profound. Today, employees, partners, customers and investors expect more from the corporation and its Board of Directors than ever before. 
The Chevron Board not only guides enterprise direction, 
but also continuously assesses internal and external views on a variety of topics, from energy market conditions and geopolitical developments to technology trends and competitor actions. Our Board has a proven track record across a broad range of experiences, including leadership of global businesses and international affairs; expertise in science, technology and engineering; extensive knowledge of governmental, regulatory, legal, environmental and public policy issues; and complex financial management, capital allocation and reporting processes.
Diversity of gender, ethnicity, age, skills and experience  
fosters the different perspectives that make our Board’s 
oversight and decision making more effective. 
The Chevron Board meets six times a year, often including 
field visits that provide insight into our human capital and operations. In 2018, the Board visited Argentina for an in-depth look at Chevron’s efforts to advance the development of Vaca Muerta — one of the largest deposits of shale oil and gas in the world — and support our company’s continued investment and commitment to economic growth in the area.
