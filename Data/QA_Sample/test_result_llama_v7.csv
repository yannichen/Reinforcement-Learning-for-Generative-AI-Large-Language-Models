(2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: In order to achieve the long-term 
temperature goal set out in Article 2, parties aim to reach global 
peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, 
recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country 
parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance 
with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between 
anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of 
greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of 
equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to 
eradicate poverty.

New material capex investment
For the purposes of the 2020 evaluation discussed on pages 28-32, ‘new 
material capex investment’ means a decision taken by the resource 
commitment meeting (RCM) in 2020 to incur inorganic or organic 
investments greater than $250 million that relate to a new project or 
asset, extending an existing project or asset, or acquiring or increasing a 
share in a project, asset or entity.
There were three investments that met the above criteria in 2020. 
Material capex evaluation: Paris-consistency quantitative tests.
For the purposes of evaluating material capex investments for 
consistency with the Paris goals, two quantitative tests were applied, see 
page 32.
1.Operational carbon intensity (CI)
The annual average operational GHG emissions (TeCO 2e/unit), divided 
by the relevant unit of output: 
•per thousand barrels of oil equivalent in Upstream
•per utilized equivalent distillation capacity in refining
•per thousand tonnes in petrochemicals.
Net zero aims and ambition glossary
Net zero
References to global net zero in the phrase, 'to help the world get to net 
zero', means achieving '...a balance between anthropogenic emissions by 
sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases...on the basis of 
equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to 
eradicate poverty', as set out in Article 4(1) of the Paris Agreement. 
References to net zero for bp in the context of our ambition and Aims 1 
and 2 as set out on page 49  (such as 'be a net zero company by 2050 or 
sooner'), means achieving a balance between (a) the relevant Scope 1 and 
2 emissions (for our Aim 1), or Scope 3 emissions (for our Aim 2), and (b) 
the aggregate of applicable deductions from qualifying activities such as","bp aims to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, as stated on page 49. This means that bp's Scope 1 and 2 emissions (for Aim 1) or Scope 3 emissions (for Aim 2) will be balanced with applicable deductions from qualifying activities, aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement and contributing to sustainable development and poverty eradication efforts.",BP PLC_2020, Bp aims to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner. This ambition is aligned with the EU's goal of achieving a climate-neutral economy by 2050. Bp will contribute to this goal by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our operations and promoting sustainable development. The board has established a cross-functional working group to oversee the implementation of this aim. The group consists of representatives from various departments and aims to ensure that bp's sustainability ambition is well-understood and executed. The board has also

Appointment and time 
commitment
The chairman, senior independent director  
and other NEDs each have letters of appointment 
and do not serve, nor are they employed, in any 
executive capacity. There is no fixed term limit  
on a director’s service; however, in line with good 
governance practice, bp proposes all directors  
for annual re-election by shareholders.Unlike the chairman’s letter of appointment, the 
NEDs’ letters of appointment do not set a fixed 
time commitment. NEDs are expected to allocate 
appropriate time to effectively discharge their 
duties. The time required of NEDs fluctuates 
depending on the demands of bp business and 
other events. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well  
as the oversight by the board of the energy 
transition and associated workload, required  
the NEDs to spend considerably more time 
fulfilling their responsibilities towards bp during 
2020, than in previous years. This included  
NEDs dedicating additional time through regular 
calls with the leadership team to remain informed 
and help guide the executive through 
unprecedented times. 
The NEDs’ external time commitments are 
regularly reviewed, ensuring that, even in the 
exceptional circumstances of a global pandemic, 
the NEDs are able to allocate appropriate time  
to bp. The review process is managed by the 
company secretary, considering NEDs’ outside 
appointments and commitments, including 
relevant factors such as complexity of company 
and industry, in particular highly regulated 
sectors, and issues impacting these other 
companies. The board has concluded that, 
notwithstanding the NEDs’ other appointments, 
they are each able to dedicate sufficient time  
to fulfil their bp duties. 
Executive directors are normally permitted to  
take up one board appointment at an external 
company, subject to the agreement of the 
chairman and after consultation with the 
company secretary. Bernard Looney and Murray

Germany will pay a fixed price for emissions certificates of EUR 25 per 
tonne CO2 in 2021 rising to EUR 55 per tonne by 2025. In 2026,

2020, China promulgated the national regulation on National ETS which 
became effective on 1 February 2021, when the National ETS was 
officially launched . 
•China has also adopted more stringent vehicle tailpipe emission 
standards and vehicle efficiency standards to address air pollution and 
GHG emissions. These standards will have an impact on transportation 
fuel product mix and overall demand. In addition, China has also 
introduced a mandate for sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) 
commencing in 2020. This has been accelerating NEV penetration into 
the light vehicle sector and impact light fuel demand.

Saudi Aramco  Annual Report 2020  |  AramcoDear Shareholders,
In 2020, no industry or company was 
immune to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic — including ours.
Aramco, for its part, demonstrated 
considerable financial and widespread operational agility during the most volatile year the world has seen in generations. With the majority of our 
employees working in field locations, we 
proactively put in place comprehensive protective measures to safeguard their safety and well-being, while maintaining our operational integrity and reliability. 
With COVID-19 making daily work and 
life more complex, we benefited from having previously adopted advanced technology and building a robust IT infrastructure — all of which allowed 
us to adjust quickly and enabled our 
employees who could work remotely, 
to do so. 
As part of the battle against COVID-19, we provided support for Saudi Arabia’s healthcare sector, including donating ventilators and other medical equipment and supplies. Our affiliates in Asia, Europe, and North America also engaged in similar initiatives.
Maintaining financial resilience 
Despite the economic fallout of the pandemic, we declared a dividend 
of SAR 281 billion ($75 billion) to our 
shareholders for the year.","According to Aramco, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors are a rising priority for investors today.",Saudi Aramco_2020," Aramco places a high priority on compliance with international sanctions and preventing money laundering. The Company strictly adheres to these sanctions and ensures that they are not used to facilitate illegal activities.

To shine a spotlight on Aramco’s ability to deliver on its commitments and create value for investors, the report highlights the significant improvements in the downstream sector and the growth of new industries.

average temperature to below 2°C above preindustrial levels.
As one of the world’s largest integrated 
energy and chemicals companies, Aramco has a role to play in helping to build a lower carbon economy, while delivering the energy and materials needed to support economic growth and societal well-being in a world that will have 
9.8 billion inhabitants by 2050, according 
to the United Nations.While the energy system is constantly growing and evolving, Aramco believes the transition to a lower carbon system will continue to require hydrocarbon-based resources for many years. While alternatives to traditional hydrocarbon-based energy sources are progressing, they are not expected to meet future energy demand on their own in the 
near-term. With existing infrastructure 
and the relatively low-cost and high 
utility  of oil and gas, the world needs 
low emission hydrocarbon solutions 
to meet both the challenge of continued 
high energy demand and the imperative of economic development. Aramco believes it plays a leading role in this.
Aramco is a founding member of the 
Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), and 
collaborates within the industry through 
memberships in joint platforms, including IPIECA, the Petroleum Environmental 
Research Forum, and the World Bank’s 
“Zero Routine Flaring by 2030” initiative.
Aramco welcomes engagement with 
stakeholders and is focused on 
increasing  transparency for its 
stakeholders around the Company’s response to climate change. 74Aramco is a founding member of

pandemic will impact our future results, which could be material. 
Chevron entered this crisis well positioned with a strong balance sheet, flexible capital program and low cash flow breakeven 
price. To protect its long-term health and value, the company took swift action, adjusting the items it can control. The 
company lowered its capital expenditures 35 percent and lowered its operating expense, excluding non-recurring severance 
costs, by $1.4 billion compared to 2019. The company completed an enterprise-wide transformation that is expected to 
capture additional cost efficiencies. Additionally, the company suspended its stock repurchase program in March 2020. 
Taken together, these actions are consistent with our financial priorities: to protect the dividend, to prioritize capital spend 
that drives long-term value, and to maintain a strong balance sheet. The company expects to continue to have sufficient 
liquidity and access to both commercial paper and debt capital markets due to its strong balance sheet and investment grade 
credit ratings. Additionally, the company has access to nearly $10 billion in committed credit facilities. 
The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due 
to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower 
tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of 
expected results in future periods. Note 15 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years.

10,What long-term rate of return did the company use for U.S. pension plan assets in 2020?,"For 2020, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.50 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account
for 65 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In both 2019 and 2018, the company used a long-term rate of return of6.75 percent for these plans.
The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on
the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month timeperiod long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous tothe end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.

This rate was determined based on actuarial studies and took into account the company’s overall financial condition and results of operations. The actual return for 2020 was 7.9 percent, which was lower than the company’s long-term rate of return. This suggests that the plan assets were underfunded for that year."

It examines any significant proposed organizational change impacting at least two companies in two European countries and expresses its opinion on this in addition to the procedures initiated before the national representative bodies. Innovative measures that allowed improved dialogue with members of the European Works Council in the past (field safety visits and learning expeditions  
to discuss the Group’s strategy directly on site) have been re-included in the agreement that established the new Total European Works Council.111 Universal Registration Document 2020  TOTAL Chapter 3  / Risks and control

monitored risks in view of the potential consequences. New facility construction projects comply with international technical standards from the design stage in order to limit exposure. For production sites operated by a Group entity and subject to this risk, the One MAESTRO reference framework sets out the prevention process in several stages. First, hazardous products such as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMR) chemicals are listed and their risks identified. Second, potential exposure to levels that may present a risk to the health of personnel, contractors or local residents at the site or nearby are identified and assessed, and prevention or attenuation measures are implemented in order to control the risk. Lastly, the approach is checked (atmospheric checks, specific medical monitoring, audits etc.) in order to verify its effectiveness and implement improvement measures if necessary. This is also set out formally in a risk assessment file, which is revised regularly by the Subsidiary.
Limiting the environmental footprint of the Group’s sites
TOTAL implements a policy of avoiding, reducing, managing and monitoring the environmental footprint of its operations. As part of  this policy, emissions are identified and quantified by environment  (water, air and soil) so that appropriate measures can be taken to better control them.
Water, air
The Group’s operations generate discharges such as smokes from combustion plants, emissions into the air from the various conversion processes and discharges of wastewater. In addition to complying with applicable legislation, TOTAL has drawn up rules and guidelines that the Group’s Subsidiaries can use to limit the quantities discharged. TOTAL has set itself targets for reducing sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions and is 
committed to limiting its hydrocarbon discharges into water. After analysis, the exposed sites can introduce various reduction systems that include organizational measures (such as using predictive models to control peaks in sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions based on weather forecast 
data and the improvement of combustion process management, etc.) and technical measures (wastewater treatment plants, using low NO
X 
burners and electrostatic scrubbers, etc.). To date, all refineries wholly owned by the Group have this type of system.
For new facilities developed by the Group, the internal rules require 
impact a
ssessments to be carried out and, if necessary, actions must  
be taken to limit the impact of these emissions.
Soil
The risks of soil pollution related to TOTAL ’s operations come mainly   
from accidental spills and waste storage. TOTAL has drawn up a guide that the Subsidiaries can use to prevent and contain this pollution.

Changes in the Group’s headcount
The number of employees fell by 2.1% (2,300 employees) between 2019 
to 2020. This decrease is mainly due to the adequate management of recruitments. In 2020, 9,354 employees were hired on a permanent contract within the consolidated scope, a decrease of 36% compared to 2019. Indeed, in view of the global economic crisis in 2020, TOTAL chose to capitalize on its existing strengths in order to weather the storm. To maintain cost discipline — a pillar of its efforts to respond to the crisis — the Group largely narrowed its hiring; industries that are driving the Group’s transformation, such as new energies and digital technology, keeping more to secure TOTAL ’s future. In particular, TOTAL hires experienced candidates for positions requiring key skills, offering them long-term career prospects within the Group.
The variations in the breakdown by region and by business segment are 
mainly du

SunPower subsidiaries (more than 5,000 employees mainly in Mexico and Asia-Pacific) and the entry of a Marketing & Services subsidiary in Saudi Arabia and a German subsidiary in Refining & Chemicals, representing more than 3,500 employees.

It specifies the performance criteria, the vesting schedule, and the potential payout structure for these awards. The agreement is designed to align the interests of the officers with the long-term success of the company and incentivize them to achieve specific performance goals.",Marathon Petroleum Corporation_2020," The Form of 2020 Officer Performance agreement is described in Exhibit 10.36.

5,What is the potential impact of the Tenth Circuit's decision on the EPA's reallocation of volumes exempted in 2020?,"has proposed to reallocate to non-exempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners 
that were granted a small refinery exemption. Also, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a small 
refinery is eligible for an exemption from the RFS only if it is applying for an extension of its original 
exemption. According to the EPA’s data, seven refineries were granted the small refinery exemption in 
2015. The United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in the 10th Circuit case. If the 10th Circuit 
decision is upheld, EPA’s reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 
2020. The reallocation of volumes under the 2020 rule or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions 
granted to us or other refiners could result in a decrease in the RIN bank, an increase in the price of RINs or 
an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend, any of which could increase MPC’s 
RFS cost of compliance. Further, the EPA has failed to promulgate timely the annual renewable fuel 
standards for 2021.
The RFS is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure 
constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline (“E10”). Since 
2016, the volume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the E10 
blendwall, which will require obligated parties to either sell E15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed 
historical levels or retire carryover RINs.
There is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of the RINs sold on the open market. We 
have developed a RIN integrity program to vet the RINs that we purchase, and we incur costs to audit RIN 
generators. Nevertheless, if any of the RINs that we purchase and use for compliance are found to be 
invalid, we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid RINs.
14In addition to the federal Renewable Fuel Standards, certain states have, or are considering, promulgation 
of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards. For example, California began implementing its Low 
Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) in January 2011. In September 2015, the CARB approved the re-adoption 
of the LCFS, which became effective on January 1, 2016, to address procedural deficiencies in the way the 
original regulation was adopted. The LCFS was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 
20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030. We incur costs to comply with 
the California LCFS, and these costs may increase if the cost of LCFS credits increases.
In sum, the RFS has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or 
expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. We may experience a decrease in demand 
for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced","If the Tenth Circuit decision is upheld, the EPA's reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 2020. This could result in a decrease in the RIN bank, an increase in the price of RINs, or an increase in the amount of renewable fuel companies are required to blend, thereby increasing the cost of compliance for refiners like ExxonMobil.",Marathon Petroleum Corporation_2020," The Tenth Circuit's decision in Marra v. EPA, which invalidated the 2014-2016 volumes, requires the EPA to reconsider the 2020-2021 volumes. If the 2020-2021 volumes are revised in a manner that increases the renewable fuel content, it could increase our RFS cost of compliance. Alternatively, if the 2020-2021 volumes remain unchanged, it could create uncertainty and increase our RFS cost of compliance. The impact of the"

10,What is the basis for pricing in our Refining & Marketing contracts?,"• Refining & Marketing - The vast majority of our Refining & Marketing contracts contain pricing 
that is based on the market price for the product at the time of delivery. Our obligations to deliver 
product volumes are typically satisfied and revenue is recognized when control of the product 
transfers to our customers. Concurrent with the transfer of control, we typically receive the right to 
payment for the delivered product, the customer accepts the product and the customer has 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product. Payment terms require customers to pay 
shortly after delivery and do not contain significant financing components. 
• Midstream - Midstream revenue transactions typically are defined by contracts under which we 
sell a product or provide a service. Revenues from sales of product are recognized when control of 
the product transfers to the customer. Revenues from sales of services are recognized over time 
when the performance obligation is satisfied as services are provided in a series. We have elected 
to use the output measure of progress to recognize revenue based on the units delivered, processed 
or transported. The transaction prices in our Midstream contracts often have both fixed 
components, related to minimum volume commitments, and variable components, which are 
primarily dependent on volumes. Variable consideration will generally not be estimated at contract 
inception as the transaction price is specifically allocable to the services provided at each period

transfers to our customers. Concurrent with the transfer of control, we typically receive the right to 
payment for the delivered product, the customer accepts the product and the customer has 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product. Payment terms require customers to pay 
shortly after delivery and do not contain significant financing components. 
• Midstream - Midstream revenue transactions typically are defined by contracts under which we 
sell a product or provide a service. Revenues from sales of product are recognized when control of 
the product transfers to the customer. Revenues from sales of services are recognized over time 
when the performance obligation is satisfied as services are provided in a series. We have elected 
to use the output measure of progress to recognize revenue based on the units delivered, processed 
or transported. The transaction prices in our Midstream contracts often have both fixed 
components, related to minimum volume commitments, and variable components, which are 
primarily dependent on volumes. Variable consideration will generally not be estimated at contract 
inception as the transaction price is specifically allocable to the services provided at each period 
end.

There is also a provision that allows certain producer customers to cancel processing arrangements in the case of significant delays not caused by force majeure.",Marathon Petroleum Corporation_2020," At December 31, 2020, our contractual commitments to acquire property, plant, and equipment amounted to $119 million. These commitments primarily involved the acquisition of assets pursuant to sales agreements and purchase and sales agreements for goodwill. The estimated total amount of non-cash commitments for operating leases was $266 million, with a net present value of $19 million. The total commitments were primarily related to our natural gas and propane operations. See Note 6."
22,How are the results of Speedway reported in our consolidated statements of income?,"Other guarantees 
We have entered into other guarantees with maximum potential undiscounted payments totaling $99 
million as of December 31, 2020, which primarily consist of a commitment to contribute cash to an equity 
method investee for certain catastrophic events, in lieu of procuring insurance coverage, a commitment to 
fund a share of the bonds issued by a government entity for construction of public utilities in the event that 
other industrial users of the facility default on their utility payments and leases of assets containing general 
lease indemnities and guaranteed residual values.
General guarantees associated with dispositions 
Over the years, we have sold various assets in the normal course of our business. Certain of the related 
agreements contain performance and general guarantees, including guarantees regarding inaccuracies in 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, and environmental and general indemnifications 
that require us to perform upon the occurrence of a triggering event or condition. These guarantees and 
159indemnifications are part of the normal course of selling assets. We are typically not able to calculate the 
maximum potential amount of future payments that could be made under such contractual provisions 
because of the variability inherent in the guarantees and indemnities. Most often, the nature of the 
guarantees and indemnities is such that there is no appropriate method for quantifying the exposure because 
the underlying triggering event has little or no past experience upon which a reasonable prediction of the 
outcome can be based.
Contractual Commitments and Contingencies
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our contractual commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment 
and advance funds to equity method investees totaled $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. 
Certain natural gas processing and gathering arrangements require us to construct natural gas processing 
plants, natural gas gathering pipelines and NGL pipelines and contain certain fees and charges if specified 
construction milestones are not achieved for reasons other than force majeure. In certain cases, certain 
producer customers may have the right to cancel the processing arrangements if there are significant delays 
that are not due to force majeure.

been transferred and the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, but 
the Group has not retained control.
On derecognition of other equity instrument investments, the difference between the carrying amounts and the sum of the consideration 
received and any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, is recognised in retained earnings. While 
on derecognition of other financial assets, this difference is recognised in profit or loss.
(b) Financial liabilities
The Group, at initial recognition, classifies financial liabilities as either financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost or 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group ’s financial liabilities are mainly financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, including bills payable, accounts payable, other 
payables, loans and debentures payable, etc. These financial liabilities are initially measured at the amount of their fair value after deducting 
transaction costs and use the effective interest rate method for subsequent measurement.
Where the present obligations of financial liabilities are completely or partially discharged, the Group derecognises these financial liabilities 
or discharged parts of obligations. The differences between the carrying amounts and the consideration received are recognised in profit or

(c) Determination of fair value
If there is an active market for financial instruments, the quoted price in the active market is used to measure fair values of the financial 
instruments. If no active market exists for financial instruments, valuation techniques are used to measure fair values. In valuation, the Group adopts valuation techniques that are applicable in the current situation and have sufficient available data and other information to support it,

relevant assets or liabilities, and gives priority to relevant observable input values. Use of unobservable input values where relevant observable input values cannot be obtained or are not practicable.
(d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. At each balance sheet date, the fair value is remeasured. The gain or 
loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting is a method which recognises the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item in the same accounting period, to represent the effect of risk management activities.","The Group classifies their financial assets based on criteria such as whether they are loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets.

If there is an active market, the quoted price in that market is used as the fair value. If there is no active market, the Group uses valuation techniques that consider relevant observable input values and available data to determine fair value. This ensures that the fair value reflects the asset or liability characteristics as valued by market participants.",Sinopec_2020," The Group uses various valuation techniques to determine fair value. These techniques include the asset approach, the income approach, and the sales-based approach. The fair value is mainly measured through observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices included within the fair value measure. The Group also considers inputs that are inputs other than quoted prices included within the fair value measure. The fair value of an asset or a liability is the fair value that is readily determinable for the purpose of measurement.

20,What was the operating revenue of the refining and chemical production segment in 2020?,"the Company ’s refining and chemical 
production. Most of the natural gas and 
a small portion of crude oil were sold 
externally to other customers.
In 2020, the operating revenues of 
this segment was RMB 167.8 billion, representing a decrease of 20.4% over 
2019. This was mainly attributed to the 
decrease of realised price in crude oil, natural gas and LNG.
In 2020, the segment sold 34.52 million 
tonnes of crude oil, representing an 
increase of 0.5% over 2019. Natural 
gas sales volume was 27.8 billion cubic meters (bcm), representing a decrease 
of 3.6% over 2019. Regasified LNG sales 
volume was 15.7 bcm, representing an increase of 40.3% over 2019. LNG 
sales volume was 6.17 million tonnes, 
representing an increase of 30.2% over 2019. Average realised prices of crude 
oil, natural gas, Regasified LNG, and LNG 
were RMB 1,902 per tonne, RMB 1,360 per thousand cubic meters, RMB 1,774 
per thousand cubic meters, and RMB 
2,543 per tonne, representing decrease of 33.6%, 13.2%, 13.0%, and 23.1% 
respectively over 2019.In 2020, the operating expenses of 
this segment was RMB 184.2 billion, representing a decrease of 8.5% over 
2019. That was mainly due to the 
following:
• Procurement cost decreased by RMB 
12.0 billion year on year, as a result 
of decrease of LNG price;
• Depreciation, depletion and 
amortisation decreased by RMB 4.5 
billion year on year;
• Cost of power fuel and purchased 
materials decreased by RMB 2.1 
billion year on year;
• Resource Tax and special oil income 
levy decreased by RMB 2.0 billion year on year;
• Impairment losses on long-lived 
assets increased by RMB 7.9 billion 
year on year;
In 2020, the oil and gas lifting cost was RMB 729.59 per tonne, representing a 
year on year decrease of 6.7%, mainly attributable to the decrease in the cost 
of purchased material, fuels, and power 
since the upstream segment proactively reinforced the cost control to cope with 
the low oil price environment.In 2020, the operating loss of the 
exploration and production segment was RMB 16.5 billion, representing a decrease 
of RMB 25.8 billion compared with 
2019, mainly attributable to decrease of international oil prices.
(2) Refining Segment
Business activities of the refining 
segment include purchasing crude oil 
from third parties and the exploration and production segment of the Company, 
as well as processing crude oil into 
refined petroleum products. Gasoline, diesel and kerosene are sold internally to 
the marketing and distribution segment 
of the Company; part of the chemical feedstock is sold to the chemicals 
segment of the Company; and other 
refined petroleum products are sold externally to both domestic and overseas 
customers.
In 2020, the operating revenues of 
this segment was RMB 944.5 billion, 
representing a decrease of 22.8% over 2019. This was mainly attributed to

30,What are proved developed oil and gas reserves?,"Proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered: 
a. Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required 
equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well.
b. Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the 
extraction is by means not involving a well.
Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on 
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
The taxes, fees and royalty in China are domestic tax schemes and are paid in cash to PRC authorities. The proved 
reserves includes quantities that are ultimately produced and sold to pay these taxes, fees and royalty.
Proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were based on reports prepared by DeGolyer and 
MacNaughton, Gaffney, Cline & Associates, McDaniel & Associates, Ryder Scott and GLJ independent engineering 
consultants.

a. Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required 
equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well.
b. Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the 
extraction is by means not involving a well.
Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on 
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
The taxes, fees and royalty in China are domestic tax schemes and are paid in cash to PRC authorities. The proved 
reserves includes quantities that are ultimately produced and sold to pay these taxes, fees and royalty.
