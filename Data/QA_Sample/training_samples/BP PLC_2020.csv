(1) Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement states the goal of ‘Holding the 
increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above 
pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this 
would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change’.
(2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: In order to achieve the long-term 
temperature goal set out in Article 2, parties aim to reach global 
peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, 
recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country 
parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance 
with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between

Are all the bp Non-Executive Directors independent?,"satisfied itself that there were no matters  
giving rise to any conflict of interests or which 
compromised the independence of the NEDs.  
It has therefore concluded that all bp NEDs  
are independent.
Professor Dame Ann Dowling continues to serve 
on the board notwithstanding that she has served 
beyond nine years as a NED. Following careful 
consideration, the board believes that Ann 
continues to provide constructive challenge and 
robust scrutiny of matters that come before the 
board and the committee on which she serves. 
She has only served with the current executive 
directors for a year and the overall average tenure 
of the board is below the FTSE 100 average. In 
addition, in 2018 the board undertook significant 
refreshment of its composition. Accordingly,  
the board is satisfied that Ann continues to 
demonstrate the qualities of independence  
in carrying out her duties.
Appointment and time 
commitment
The chairman, senior independent director  
and other NEDs each have letters of appointment 
and do not serve, nor are they employed, in any 
executive capacity. There is no fixed term limit  
on a director’s service; however, in line with good 
governance practice, bp proposes all directors  
for annual re-election by shareholders.Unlike the chairman’s letter of appointment, the 
NEDs’ letters of appointment do not set a fixed 
time commitment. NEDs are expected to allocate 
appropriate time to effectively discharge their 
duties. The time required of NEDs fluctuates 
depending on the demands of bp business and 
other events. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well  
as the oversight by the board of the energy 
transition and associated workload, required  
the NEDs to spend considerably more time 
fulfilling their responsibilities towards bp during 
2020, than in previous years. This included  
NEDs dedicating additional time through regular 
calls with the leadership team to remain informed 
and help guide the executive through 
unprecedented times. 
The NEDs’ external time commitments are 
regularly reviewed, ensuring that, even in the 
exceptional circumstances of a global pandemic, 
the NEDs are able to allocate appropriate time  
to bp. The review process is managed by the 
company secretary, considering NEDs’ outside 
appointments and commitments, including 
relevant factors such as complexity of company 
and industry, in particular highly regulated 
sectors, and issues impacting these other 
companies. The board has concluded that, 
notwithstanding the NEDs’ other appointments, 
they are each able to dedicate sufficient time  
to fulfil their bp duties. 
Executive directors are normally permitted to  
take up one board appointment at an external 
company, subject to the agreement of the 
chairman and after consultation with the 
company secretary. Bernard Looney and Murray 
Auchincloss each hold one non-executive 
directorship, shown on page 74. Prior to retiring

What is the stamp duty reserve tax rate for purchases of ordinary shares made outside of the CREST system?,"when the condition is fulfilled). The stamp duty reserve tax will apply to 
agreements to transfer ordinary shares even if the agreement is made 
outside the UK between two non-residents. Purchases of ordinary shares 
outside the CREST system are subject either to stamp duty at a rate of 
£5 per £1,000  (or part, unless the stamp duty is less than £5, when no 
stamp duty is charged), or stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5% . Stamp duty 
and stamp duty reserve tax are generally the liability of the purchaser.
A subsequent transfer of ordinary shares to the Depositary’s nominee will 
give rise to further stamp duty at the rate of £1.50  per £100  (or part) or 
stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 1.5%  of the value of the ordinary 
shares at the time of the transfer. For ADR holders electing to receive 
ADSs instead of cash, after the 2012 first quarter dividend payment, HM 
Revenue & Customs no longer seeks to impose 1.5%  stamp duty reserve 
tax on issues of UK shares and securities to non-EU clearance services 
and depositary receipt systems.

What is the purpose of the EU Fuel Quality Directive?,"vehicles.
•The EU Fuel Quality Directive affects our production and marketing of 
transport fuels including mandating reductions in the life cycle GHG 
emissions per unit of energy and tighter environmental fuel quality 
standards for petrol and diesel. 
•Germany is expected to launch a national emissions trading system in 
2021 for transport and heating fuels. Impacted fuel suppliers in 
Germany will pay a fixed price for emissions certificates of EUR 25 per 
tonne CO2 in 2021 rising to EUR 55 per tonne by 2025. In 2026, 
emissions certificates will be auctioned but with prices limited between 
EUR 55 and EUR 65 per tonne CO2 emitted.  A review of the system is 
expected to take place in 2025 to determine the position beyond 2026.

•In December 2020 the UK Government announced a targeted reduction 
in the UK’s GHG emissions of at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 
levels. The UK also announced an emissions trading system from 1 January 2021 onwards which would include the same installations in 
the UK that were previously subject to the EU ETS.
•China is operating emission trading pilot programmes in five cities and 
three provinces. One of bp's subsidiaries « and one of bp’s joint 
venture« companies in China are participating in these schemes. China 
launched its national emissions trading market (National ETS), initially 
covering the power sector only, politically in 2017. On 31 December 
2020, China promulgated the national regulation on National ETS which 
became effective on 1 February 2021, when the National ETS was 
officially launched . 
•China has also adopted more stringent vehicle tailpipe emission 
standards and vehicle efficiency standards to address air pollution and 
GHG emissions. These standards will have an impact on transportation 
fuel product mix and overall demand. In addition, China has also 
introduced a mandate for sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) 
commencing in 2020. This has been accelerating NEV penetration into 
the light vehicle sector and impact light fuel demand.

In addition to GHG regulations including current and proposed fuel 
and product specifications and emission controls (including control of 
vehicle emissions) referred to above, climate change programmes 
and regulation of unconventional oil and gas extraction under a 
number of environmental laws may have a significant effect on the 
production, sale and profitability of many of bp’s products.
