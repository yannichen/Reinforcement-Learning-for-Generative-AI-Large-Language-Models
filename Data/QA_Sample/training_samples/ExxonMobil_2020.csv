What factors are considered in the estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes?,"petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Corporation’s accounting policies 
are summarized in Note 1.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, 
commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, 
development and production costs, among other factors. The estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the Corporation through 
long-standing approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level 
geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves and Resources Group which has significant technical 
experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management. Notably, the Corporation does not use specific 
quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation. Key features of the reserve estimation process are covered in Disclosure of 
Reserves in Item 2.
Oil and natural gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves.
• Proved oil and natural gas reserves are determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
requirements. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, 
can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions and 
government regulations. Proved reserves are determined using the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices during 
the reporting year.
Proved reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves include 
amounts which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved 
undeveloped reserves include amounts expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing 
wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Proved undeveloped reserves are recognized only if a 
development plan has been adopted indicating that the reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific 
circumstances support a longer period of time.
The percentage of proved developed reserves was 67 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2020 (including both 
consolidated and equity company reserves), an increase from 66 percent in 2019, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten 
years. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered","The estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes takes into account rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines. Development and production costs are also considered during the estimation process."

What is the impact of the adoption of the accounting standard on ExxonMobil's share of equity in terms of reduction? (Data query),"cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of this standard reduced ExxonMobil's share of equity by $93 million.
The Corporation is exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural 
gas, as well as loans to equity companies and joint venture receivables. A counterparty’s ability to pay is assessed through a credit 
review process that considers payment terms, the counterparty’s established credit rating or the Corporation’s assessment of the 
counterparty’s credit worthiness, contract terms, country of operation, and other risks. The Corporation can require prepayment or 
collateral to mitigate certain credit risks.
The Corporation groups financial assets into portfolios that share similar risk characteristics for purposes of determining the allowance 
for credit losses and assesses if a significant change in the risk of credit loss has occurred. Among the quantitative and qualitative 
factors considered are historical financial data, current conditions, industry and country risk, current credit ratings and the quality of 
third-party guarantees secured from the counterparty. Financial assets are written off in whole, or in part, when practical recovery 
efforts have been exhausted and no reasonable expectation of recovery exists. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are recognized in earnings. The Corporation manages receivable portfolios using past due balances as a key credit quality indicator.
The Corporation recognizes a credit allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures as a liability on the balance sheet, separate from 
the allowance for credit losses related to recognized financial assets. Among these exposures are unfunded loans to equity companies 
and financial guarantees that cannot be cancelled unilaterally by the Corporation.

What was the net profit of the company in 2019?,"2019
Chemical earnings of $592 million decreased $2,759 million from 2018.
• Weaker margins decreased earnings by $1.8 billion.
• Volume and mix effects were essentially flat, as lower sales volumes were offset by new asset contributions.
• All other items decreased earnings by $940 million, primarily due to higher expenses associated with new assets, business 
growth, and maintenance activity, the absence of a favorable tax item in the prior year, and unfavorable foreign exchange 
impacts.
• U.S. Chemical earnings were $206 million in 2019, compared with $1,642 million in the prior year.
• Non-U.S. Chemical earnings were $386 million, compared with $1,709 million in the prior year.

10620. Restructuring Activities
During 2020, ExxonMobil conducted an extensive global review of staffing levels and subsequently commenced targeted workforce 
reductions within a number of countries to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The programs, which are expected to be substantially 
completed by the end of 2021, include both voluntary and involuntary employee separations and reductions in contractors.
In 2020 the Corporation recorded before-tax charges of $450 million, consisting primarily of employee separation costs, associated 
with announced workforce reduction programs in Europe, North America, and Australia. These costs are captured in “Selling, general 
and administrative expenses” on the Statement of Income and reported in the Corporate and financing segment. The Corporation 
estimates additional charges of up to $200 million in 2021 related to planned workforce reduction programs.
The following table summarizes the reserves and charges related to the workforce reduction programs, which are recorded in 
“Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.”
