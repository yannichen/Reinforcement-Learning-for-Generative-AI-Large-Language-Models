How does Saudi Aramco account for its investments in joint ventures?,"2) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of 
the joint arrangement. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost.
Saudi Aramco’s share of results of its joint ventures is recognized within net income, while its share of post-acquisition movements in other 
comprehensive income is recognized within other comprehensive income. The cumulative effect of these changes is adjusted against the carrying 
amount of Saudi Aramco’s investments in joint ventures, which is presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. When Saudi Aramco’s 
share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, including any other unsecured non-current receivables, 
Saudi Aramco does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Gains and losses on transactions between Saudi Aramco and joint ventures not realized through a sale to a third party are eliminated to the 
extent of Saudi Aramco’s interest in the joint ventures. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of joint ventures 
to align their accounting policies with those used by Saudi Aramco.
Saudi Aramco’s investments in joint ventures includes, when applicable, goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment 
loss. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of Saudi Aramco’s share of the net identifiable assets of the 
acquired joint venture at the date of acquisition. Dilution gains and losses arising from investments in joint ventures are recognized in net income.
Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
(iii) Associates
Associates are entities over which Saudi Aramco has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in financial and 
operating policy decisions but with no control or joint control over those policies and is generally reflected by a shareholding of between 20% 
and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at 
cost. The accounting policies for joint ventures detailed in Note 2(d)(ii)(2) above are also applied by Saudi Aramco to its associates.
 
Significant accounting judgments and estimates
Judgments are applied in the determination of whether control, joint control or significant influence is present with respect to investments in 
non-wholly owned subsidiaries, joint arrangements or associates, respectively. For control, judgment is applied when determining if an entity is",Investments in joint ventures by Saudi Aramco are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Financial position
Total assets  were SAR 1,494,126 ($398,434) 
as at December 31, 2019, compared to 
SAR 1,346,892 ($359,171) as at December 31, 
2018. This increase was mainly attributable to 
an increase in property, plant and equipment 
and short-term investments.
The increase in property, plant and 
equipment primarily reflects additions from 
capital expenditures incurred during the 
year, the acquisitions of SASREF and Motiva 
Chemicals LLC (previously Flint Hills), and the 
recognition of right-of-use assets upon the 
adoption of IFRS 16. 
The increase in short-term investments was 
driven by the investment of cash receipts 
following the issuance of the Senior Unsecured 
Notes in April 2019.Total liabilities  were SAR 447,891 
($119,438) at December 31, 2019, compared 
to SAR 318,457 ($84,922) at December 31, 
2018. This increase was primarily due to 
higher borrowings, deferred income tax 
liabilities and dividend payable.
The increase in borrowings (current and 
non-current) mainly reflects the issuance 
of the Senior Unsecured Notes and the 
recognition of additional lease liabilities 
upon the adoption of IFRS 16. 
Deferred income tax liabilities, which 
reflect the impact of temporary differences 
between the amount of assets and liabilities 
recognized for accounting purposes and

Financial position
Total assets  were SAR 1,494,126 ($398,434) 
as at December 31, 2019, compared to 
SAR 1,346,892 ($359,171) as at December 31, 
2018. This increase was mainly attributable to 
an increase in property, plant and equipment 
and short-term investments.
The increase in property, plant and 
equipment primarily reflects additions from 
capital expenditures incurred during the 
year, the acquisitions of SASREF and Motiva 
Chemicals LLC (previously Flint Hills), and the 
recognition of right-of-use assets upon the 
adoption of IFRS 16. 
The increase in short-term investments was 
driven by the investment of cash receipts 
following the issuance of the Senior Unsecured 
Notes in April 2019.Total liabilities  were SAR 447,891 
($119,438) at December 31, 2019, compared 
to SAR 318,457 ($84,922) at December 31, 
2018. This increase was primarily due to 
higher borrowings, deferred income tax 
liabilities and dividend payable.
The increase in borrowings (current and 
non-current) mainly reflects the issuance 
of the Senior Unsecured Notes and the 
recognition of additional lease liabilities 
upon the adoption of IFRS 16. 
Deferred income tax liabilities, which 
reflect the impact of temporary differences 
between the amount of assets and liabilities 
recognized for accounting purposes and 
their tax bases, increased predominantly due 
to temporary differences related to property, 
plant and equipment and the impact of the 
recent fiscal regime changes.
The dividend payable at December 31, 2019 
represents an ordinary dividend declared in 
December 2019, prior to the IPO date, and 
paid to the Government in January 2020.SAR USD*

partners or other consequences, any of 
which could have a material adverse effect 
on Saudi Aramco’s business, financial position 
and results of operations.
In addition, many of Saudi Aramco’s projects 
require significant capital expenditures. If cash 
flow from operating activities and funds from 
external financial resources are not sufficient 
to cover Saudi Aramco’s capital expenditure 
requirements, Saudi Aramco may be required 
to reallocate available capital among its 
projects or modify its capital expenditure 
plans, which may result in delays to, or 
cancellation of, certain projects or deferral 
of certain capital expenditures. Any change 
to Saudi Aramco’s capital expenditure plans 
could, in turn, have a material adverse effect 
on Saudi Aramco’s growth objectives and 
its business, financial position and results 
of operations.93
Saudi Aramco Annual Report 20191.8. Risks related to litigation
Saudi Aramco has been subject 
to litigation in the past and may 
be again in the future.Saudi Aramco has been subject to significant 
litigation, primarily in the United States and 
the Kingdom. Some of the most significant 
U.S. litigation involved allegations of violations 
of antitrust laws arising, in part, from the 
Kingdom’s membership and participation 
in OPEC. Such antitrust litigation sought 
extensive relief, including treble damages, 
divestiture of assets in the United States and 
disgorgement of profits. If granted, this relief 
could have had a material adverse impact on 
Saudi Aramco. To date, the OPEC-related 
antitrust lawsuits have been dismissed on the 
basis of various sovereign defenses under 
U.S. law, including the political question and 
the act of state doctrines, sovereign immunity 
under the FSIA and other legal defenses. 
However, there is no assurance that 
Saudi Aramco will prevail in its assertion of 
these defenses in the future and any adverse 
judgment or settlement could have an adverse 
effect on Saudi Aramco’s business, financial 
position and results of operations.
In February 2019, members of the U.S. House 
of Representatives introduced a bill that seeks 
to make unlawful certain conduct by foreign 
states, state instrumentalities and state 
agents, such as taking action collectively 
to reduce the production of oil. The draft bill 
would expressly remove or weaken certain 
sovereign defenses, including sovereign 
immunity under the FSIA. If this or any other 
legislation affecting Saudi Aramco’s legal 
liability were to become law and result in 
litigation against Saudi Aramco, such","Insufficient cash flow can have an adverse impact on Saudi Aramco's capital expenditure plans and growth objectives. If cash flow from operating activities and external financial resources is not sufficient to cover the company's capital expenditure requirements, Saudi Aramco may be forced to reallocate available capital or modify its capital expenditure plans. This can lead to delays, cancellations, or deferrals of certain projects, hindering the company's growth objectives."
