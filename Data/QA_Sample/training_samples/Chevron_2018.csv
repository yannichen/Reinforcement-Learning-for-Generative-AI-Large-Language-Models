Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that mayrequire a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.
Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions
throughout the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years hadnot been completed as of December 31, 2018. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations hadbeen finalized were as follows: United States – 2013, Nigeria – 2000, Australia – 2006 and Kazakhstan – 2007.
The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various
jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highlyuncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result insignificant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given thenumber of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various taxjurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.
On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax
positions as “Income tax expense.” As of December 31, 2018, accruals of $33 for anticipated interest and penalty obligationswere included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accruals of $178 as of year-end 2017.
