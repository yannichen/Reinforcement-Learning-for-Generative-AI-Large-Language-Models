It specifies the performance criteria, the vesting schedule, and the potential payout structure for these awards. The agreement is designed to align the interests of the officers with the long-term success of the company and incentivize them to achieve specific performance goals."
What is the potential impact of the Tenth Circuit's decision on the EPA's reallocation of volumes exempted in 2020?,"has proposed to reallocate to non-exempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners 
that were granted a small refinery exemption. Also, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a small 
refinery is eligible for an exemption from the RFS only if it is applying for an extension of its original 
exemption. According to the EPA’s data, seven refineries were granted the small refinery exemption in 
2015. The United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in the 10th Circuit case. If the 10th Circuit 
decision is upheld, EPA’s reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 
2020. The reallocation of volumes under the 2020 rule or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions 
granted to us or other refiners could result in a decrease in the RIN bank, an increase in the price of RINs or 
an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend, any of which could increase MPC’s 
RFS cost of compliance. Further, the EPA has failed to promulgate timely the annual renewable fuel 
standards for 2021.
The RFS is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure 
constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline (“E10”). Since 
2016, the volume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the E10 
blendwall, which will require obligated parties to either sell E15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed 
historical levels or retire carryover RINs.
There is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of the RINs sold on the open market. We 
have developed a RIN integrity program to vet the RINs that we purchase, and we incur costs to audit RIN 
generators. Nevertheless, if any of the RINs that we purchase and use for compliance are found to be 
invalid, we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid RINs.
14In addition to the federal Renewable Fuel Standards, certain states have, or are considering, promulgation 
of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards. For example, California began implementing its Low 
Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) in January 2011. In September 2015, the CARB approved the re-adoption 
of the LCFS, which became effective on January 1, 2016, to address procedural deficiencies in the way the 
original regulation was adopted. The LCFS was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 
20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030. We incur costs to comply with 
the California LCFS, and these costs may increase if the cost of LCFS credits increases.
In sum, the RFS has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or 
expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. We may experience a decrease in demand 
for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced","If the Tenth Circuit decision is upheld, the EPA's reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 2020. This could result in a decrease in the RIN bank, an increase in the price of RINs, or an increase in the amount of renewable fuel companies are required to blend, thereby increasing the cost of compliance for refiners like ExxonMobil."
How could the reallocation of volumes or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions affect the RIN bank and the price of RINs?,"has proposed to reallocate to non-exempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners

This is because if obligated parties like ExxonMobil are required to blend more renewable fuel to make up for the exempted volumes or the exemptions are invalidated, there will be higher demand for RINs, driving up the price and potentially depleting the RIN bank reserves."

14In addition to the federal Renewable Fuel Standards, certain states have, or are considering, promulgation 
of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards. For example, California began implementing its Low 
Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) in January 2011. In September 2015, the CARB approved the re-adoption 
of the LCFS, which became effective on January 1, 2016, to address procedural deficiencies in the way the 
original regulation was adopted. The LCFS was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 
20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030. We incur costs to comply with 
the California LCFS, and these costs may increase if the cost of LCFS credits increases.
In sum, the RFS has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or 
expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. We may experience a decrease in demand 
for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced","Vehicle, regulatory, and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline. The Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) have already caused the ethanol content in gasoline to exceed the E10 blendwall. This means that obligated parties will either need to sell higher ethanol blends like E15 or flex fuels or retire carryover RINs, as blending higher ethanol concentrations poses challenges for vehicles, regulations, and infrastructure."
Is there a regulatory method in place to verify the validity of RINs sold on the open market?,"has proposed to reallocate to non-exempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners 
that were granted a small refinery exemption. Also, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a small 
refinery is eligible for an exemption from the RFS only if it is applying for an extension of its original 
exemption. According to the EPA’s data, seven refineries were granted the small refinery exemption in 
2015. The United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in the 10th Circuit case. If the 10th Circuit 
decision is upheld, EPA’s reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 
2020. The reallocation of volumes under the 2020 rule or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions 
granted to us or other refiners could result in a decrease in the RIN bank, an increase in the price of RINs or 
an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend, any of which could increase MPC’s 
RFS cost of compliance. Further, the EPA has failed to promulgate timely the annual renewable fuel 
standards for 2021.
The RFS is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure 
constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline (“E10”). Since 
2016, the volume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the E10 
blendwall, which will require obligated parties to either sell E15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed 
historical levels or retire carryover RINs.
There is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of the RINs sold on the open market. We 
have developed a RIN integrity program to vet the RINs that we purchase, and we incur costs to audit RIN

What is the basis for pricing in our Refining & Marketing contracts?,"• Refining & Marketing - The vast majority of our Refining & Marketing contracts contain pricing 
that is based on the market price for the product at the time of delivery. Our obligations to deliver 
product volumes are typically satisfied and revenue is recognized when control of the product 
transfers to our customers. Concurrent with the transfer of control, we typically receive the right to 
payment for the delivered product, the customer accepts the product and the customer has 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product. Payment terms require customers to pay 
shortly after delivery and do not contain significant financing components. 
• Midstream - Midstream revenue transactions typically are defined by contracts under which we 
sell a product or provide a service. Revenues from sales of product are recognized when control of 
the product transfers to the customer. Revenues from sales of services are recognized over time 
when the performance obligation is satisfied as services are provided in a series. We have elected 
to use the output measure of progress to recognize revenue based on the units delivered, processed 
or transported. The transaction prices in our Midstream contracts often have both fixed 
components, related to minimum volume commitments, and variable components, which are 
primarily dependent on volumes. Variable consideration will generally not be estimated at contract 
inception as the transaction price is specifically allocable to the services provided at each period

"What is the maximum potential undiscounted payments of the other guarantees entered in December 31, 2020?","Other guarantees 
We have entered into other guarantees with maximum potential undiscounted payments totaling $99 
million as of December 31, 2020, which primarily consist of a commitment to contribute cash to an equity 
method investee for certain catastrophic events, in lieu of procuring insurance coverage, a commitment to 
fund a share of the bonds issued by a government entity for construction of public utilities in the event that 
other industrial users of the facility default on their utility payments and leases of assets containing general 
lease indemnities and guaranteed residual values.
General guarantees associated with dispositions 
Over the years, we have sold various assets in the normal course of our business. Certain of the related 
agreements contain performance and general guarantees, including guarantees regarding inaccuracies in 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, and environmental and general indemnifications 
that require us to perform upon the occurrence of a triggering event or condition. These guarantees and 
159indemnifications are part of the normal course of selling assets. We are typically not able to calculate the 
maximum potential amount of future payments that could be made under such contractual provisions 
because of the variability inherent in the guarantees and indemnities. Most often, the nature of the 
guarantees and indemnities is such that there is no appropriate method for quantifying the exposure because 
the underlying triggering event has little or no past experience upon which a reasonable prediction of the 
outcome can be based.
Contractual Commitments and Contingencies
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our contractual commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment 
and advance funds to equity method investees totaled $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. 
Certain natural gas processing and gathering arrangements require us to construct natural gas processing 
plants, natural gas gathering pipelines and NGL pipelines and contain certain fees and charges if specified 
construction milestones are not achieved for reasons other than force majeure. In certain cases, certain 
producer customers may have the right to cancel the processing arrangements if there are significant delays 
that are not due to force majeure.

million as of December 31, 2020, which primarily consist of a commitment to contribute cash to an equity 
method investee for certain catastrophic events, in lieu of procuring insurance coverage, a commitment to 
fund a share of the bonds issued by a government entity for construction of public utilities in the event that 
other industrial users of the facility default on their utility payments and leases of assets containing general 
lease indemnities and guaranteed residual values.
General guarantees associated with dispositions 
Over the years, we have sold various assets in the normal course of our business. Certain of the related 
agreements contain performance and general guarantees, including guarantees regarding inaccuracies in 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, and environmental and general indemnifications 
that require us to perform upon the occurrence of a triggering event or condition. These guarantees and 
159indemnifications are part of the normal course of selling assets. We are typically not able to calculate the 
maximum potential amount of future payments that could be made under such contractual provisions 
because of the variability inherent in the guarantees and indemnities. Most often, the nature of the 
guarantees and indemnities is such that there is no appropriate method for quantifying the exposure because 
the underlying triggering event has little or no past experience upon which a reasonable prediction of the 
outcome can be based.
Contractual Commitments and Contingencies
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our contractual commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment 
and advance funds to equity method investees totaled $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. 
Certain natural gas processing and gathering arrangements require us to construct natural gas processing 
plants, natural gas gathering pipelines and NGL pipelines and contain certain fees and charges if specified 
construction milestones are not achieved for reasons other than force majeure. In certain cases, certain 
producer customers may have the right to cancel the processing arrangements if there are significant delays

to establish citizenship, entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by U.S. citizens. If 
we fail to maintain compliance with the Maritime Laws, MPLX would be prohibited from operating vessels 
in the U.S. inland waters. Such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial

recorded in 2019 primarily related to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and 
processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition; 
• decreased selling, general and administrative expenses of $482 million mainly due to decreases in 
salaries and employee-related expenses, transaction-related expenses, credit card processing fees 
for brand customers and contract services expenses; 
• restructuring expense of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries 
and costs related to our announced workforce reduction. See See Item 8. Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data – Note 4 for additional information; and
• increased other taxes of $107 million primarily due to increased property and environmental taxes 
of approximately $78 million and $69 million, respectively. Property taxes increased in the current 
period mainly due to the absence of property tax refunds and tax exemptions received in 2019 and 
environmental taxes increased largely due to the reinstatement of the Oil Spill Tax in 2020, which 
was not in effect for all of 2019. These increases were offset by a state tax refund and reduced 
payroll tax expenses.
Net interest and other financial costs increased $136 million largely due to increased MPC borrowings and 
foreign currency exchange losses and decreased interest income. We capitalized interest of $129 million in 
2020 and $158 million in 2019. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for

Provision for income taxes decreased $3.21 billion primarily due to decreased income before taxes of 
$16.85 billion. The effective tax rate of 18 percent in 2020 is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 
percent, primarily due to a significant amount of our pre-tax loss consisting of non-tax deductible goodwill 
impairment charges, partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the expected net operating 
57loss carryback provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Additionally, our 
effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in MPLX, but this benefit was lower

The effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily

environmental taxes increased largely due to the reinstatement of the Oil Spill Tax in 2020, which 
was not in effect for all of 2019. These increases were offset by a state tax refund and reduced 
payroll tax expenses.
Net interest and other financial costs increased $136 million largely due to increased MPC borrowings and 
foreign currency exchange losses and decreased interest income. We capitalized interest of $129 million in 
2020 and $158 million in 2019. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for 
further details.
Provision for income taxes decreased $3.21 billion primarily due to decreased income before taxes of 
$16.85 billion. The effective tax rate of 18 percent in 2020 is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 
percent, primarily due to a significant amount of our pre-tax loss consisting of non-tax deductible goodwill 
impairment charges, partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the expected net operating 
57loss carryback provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Additionally, our 
effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in MPLX, but this benefit was lower 
for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by MPLX. 
The effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily 
due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense, partially 
offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. See 
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15 for further details.","Other taxes increased by $107 million in 2020, primarily due to increased property and environmental taxes, offset by a state tax refund and reduced payroll tax expenses."
What caused the decrease in net interest and other financial costs in 2020?,"billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the 
decline in commodity prices. It also includes impairment of long-lived assets primarily related to 
the repositioning of the Martinez refinery compared to impairment expense of $1.20 billion 
recorded in 2019 primarily related to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and 
processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition; 
• decreased selling, general and administrative expenses of $482 million mainly due to decreases in 
salaries and employee-related expenses, transaction-related expenses, credit card processing fees 
for brand customers and contract services expenses; 
• restructuring expense of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries 
and costs related to our announced workforce reduction. See See Item 8. Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data – Note 4 for additional information; and
