Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. The communication of a
critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to
which it relates.
Assessment of gross unrecognized tax benefits
As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, the Company has gross unrecognized tax
benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, of $897 million. The Company’s tax positions are subject to examination by local taxing
authorities and the resolution of such examinations may span multiple years. Due to the complexities inherent in the interpretation of
income tax laws in domestic and international jurisdictions, it is uncertain whether some of the Company’s income tax positions will be
sustained upon examination.
We identified the assessment of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because complex auditor judgment
was required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of income tax laws and assessing the Company’s estimate of the ultimate
resolution of its income tax positions.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over
the Company’s income tax process, including controls to evaluate which of the Company’s income tax positions may not be sustained upon
examination and estimate the gross unrecognized tax benefits.
We involved domestic and international income tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
•Obtaining an understanding and evaluating the Company’s income tax positions as filed or intended to be filed;
•Evaluating the Company’s interpretation of income tax laws by developing an independent assessment of the Company’s income
tax positions and comparing the results to the Company’s assessment;
•Inspecting settlements with applicable taxing authorities; and
•Assessing the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations.
In addition, we evaluated the Company’s ability to estimate its gross unrecognized tax benefits by comparing historical uncertain income","As of December 31, 2019, the company reported gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, of $897 million.

In addition, we evaluated the Company’s ability to estimate its gross unrecognized tax benefits by comparing historical uncertain income","Income tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge play a crucial role in evaluating the company's income tax positions. They are responsible for understanding and applying complex tax laws in different jurisdictions, staying updated with the evolving tax regulations, treaties, and guidelines. These professionals are involved in assessing the company's tax positions, evaluating the risks and uncertainties associated with them, and determining the appropriate tax treatment. They also play a key role in developing strategies to optimize the company's tax positions while ensuring compliance with laws and regulations."

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in
facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.
Cash Equivalents
Our cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have a maturity of
three months or less when acquired.
Receivables
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is adjusted based on
management’s assessment of our customers’ historical collection experience, known credit risks, and industry and economic conditions.
Inventories
The cost of refinery feedstocks and refined petroleum products, grain and ethanol, and renewable diesel feedstocks (animal fats, used cooking
oils, and other vegetable oils) and renewable diesel is determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO
approach, with any increments valued based on average purchase prices during the year. Our LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost
or market. The cost of products purchased for resale and the cost of materials and supplies are determined principally under the weighted-
average cost method. Our non-LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. If the aggregate market value of our
LIFO inventories or the aggregate net realizable value of our non-LIFO inventories is less than the related aggregate cost, we recognize a loss
for the difference in our statements of income.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
The cost of property, plant, and equipment (property assets) purchased or constructed, including betterments of property assets, is capitalized.
However, the cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets is expensed as incurred. Betterments of property assets are those that
extend the useful life, increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset, or improve the safety of our operations. The cost of
property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction activities.
Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property
assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical
infrastructure (Units), and these Units are continuously improved. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of
existing Units. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing
internal and external factors.
Depreciation of property assets used in our refining and renewable diesel segments is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful","Our cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have a maturity of three months or less when acquired."
