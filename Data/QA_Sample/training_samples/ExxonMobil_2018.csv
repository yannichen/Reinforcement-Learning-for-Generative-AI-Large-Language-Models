What is the definition of Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?,"Total shareholder return (TSR) • Measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a 
specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. We calculate shareholder return over a particular measurement period by: dividing (1) the sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock price at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the beginning of the measurement period. For this purpose, we assume dividends are reinvested in stock at market prices at approximately the same time actual dividends are paid. Shareholder return is usually quoted on an annualized basis.
Capital and exploration expenditures (Capex) •  Represents the combined total of additions at 
cost to property, plant and equipment, and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the 
Summary statement of income. ExxonMobil’s Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges (effective 2013), the value of ExxonMobil shares used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil’s management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.
Returns, investment returns, project returns • Unless referring specifically to ROCE, references 
to returns, investment returns, project returns and similar terms mean discounted cash flow returns based on current company estimates. Future investment returns exclude prior exploration and acquisition costs. 
Proved reserves • Proved reserve figures in this publication are determined in accordance with 
SEC definitions in effect at the end of each applicable year. In statements covering reserve 
replacement for years prior to 2009, reserves include oil sands and equity company reserves, which at the time were excluded from SEC reserves.
Proved reserves replacement ratio •  The reserves replacement ratio is calculated for a specified 
period utilizing the applicable proved oil-equivalent reserves additions divided by oil-equivalent 
production. See “Proved reserves” above.
Resources, resource base, and recoverable resources •  Along with similar terms used in this 
report, these refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are","Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. It is calculated by dividing the sum of the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus the difference between the stock price at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period, by the stock price at the beginning of the measurement period.

The Singapore butyl plant, the Newport elastomer plant expansion, and the Baytown ethane cracker all started up in 2018.

have and the scale advantage it provides, we deploy a network of technology centers around the world, staffed with scientists and engineers who collaborate globally with manufacturing sites, production units, projects, and ventures across the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical business lines. Enabled by access to global data, these engineers drive manufacturing excellence by monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing process units and equipment fleets around the world. Our technology centers are seamless extensions of our production and manufacturing sites, providing valuable technical solutions that we replicate across our global network. Best practices across similar assets are quickly and broadly applied, which leads to effective prioritization and efficient execution of high-value optimization opportunities. Equipment monitoring and process analysis enable global manufacturing circuit optimization efforts and are anticipated to generate more than $500 million in cumulative earnings contribution in our Downstream business between 2017 and 2020.",The under-construction project is expected to be operational in early 2020.

Additionally, we progressed key projects in Singapore, 
Fawley, and Beaumont, where we will expand refining capacity to process light Permian crudes.
In the Chemical business, we have started up seven new 
facilities since 2017 and are planning the completion of another six projects by 2025, supported by growing demand for high-performance chemical products. The Singapore butyl plant, the Newport elastomer plant expansion, and the Baytown ethane cracker all started up in 2018. We are also progressing additional investments in the United States and Singapore. These new facilities will result in a 40-percent increase in manufacturing capacity in North America and Asia.sites will connect to the data lake by 2020. By applying advanced analytics to this abundance of data, we can identify new approaches to run sites more efficiently and potentially with fewer emissions. 
We also have the largest inventory of operated horizontal 
wells in the United States at more than 6,600, providing our engineering and subsurface experts with one of the most extensive databases in the industry with which to learn and optimize development and operating plans. 
To fully leverage the tremendous amount of data we 
have and the scale advantage it provides, we deploy a network of technology centers around the world, staffed with scientists and engineers who collaborate globally with manufacturing sites, production units, projects, and ventures across the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical business lines. Enabled by access to global data, these engineers drive manufacturing excellence by monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing process units and equipment fleets around the world. Our technology centers are seamless extensions of our production and manufacturing sites, providing valuable technical solutions that we replicate across our global network. Best practices across similar assets are quickly and broadly applied, which leads to effective prioritization and efficient execution of high-value optimization opportunities. Equipment monitoring and process analysis enable global manufacturing circuit optimization efforts and are anticipated to generate more than $500 million in cumulative earnings contribution in our Downstream business between 2017 and 2020.","The deployment of technology centers allows for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing process units and equipment fleets around the world, driving manufacturing excellence.

How many operated horizontal wells does the company have in the United States?,"under construction and expected to be operational in early 2020.
In the Downstream, we are investing to increase the 
production of higher-value products. This includes upgrading nearly 200,000 barrels per day of fuel oil into higher-quality Group II lube basestocks, chemicals, and lower-sulfur distillates by 2025. We completed three of these projects in 2018. In Beaumont, we started up a hydrofiner to produce cleaner, lower-sulfur gasoline. We also commenced a delayed coker in Antwerp, Belgium, to upgrade heavy residual products and started up the Rotterdam, Netherlands, advanced hydrocracker to produce Group II basestocks.

We are investing in research to develop scalable and 
affordable technologies to meet the growing demand for lower-emission fuels, identify economic carbon capture, utilization, and st orage (CCUS) solutions, and 
reduce the intensity of existing manufacturing processes. 
The company made significant progress in 2018 on 
an algae biofuels program with partner Synthetic Genomics, Inc., and on cellulosic biofuels with partner Renewable Energy Group. Successes included initiation of outdoor algae pond experimentation and a substantial improvement in the bioconversion of cellulose-derived sugars from wood, grass, and agricultural waste into biodiesel. We also continued efforts to develop scalable and economically viable carbon capture and storage. Research and development in this area focused on our partnership with FuelCell Energy, Inc. and the potential to capture carbon dioxide (CO
2) while also generating 
power using a fuel cell. We also progressed efforts to identify new materials for CO
2 capture and assess 
multiple new CO 2 utilization and storage options.
Another area of ongoing research involves developing low-energy membrane and adsorption technologies that could replace the energy-intensive separation processes that exist today.
