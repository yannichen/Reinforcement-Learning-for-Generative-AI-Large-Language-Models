The group leases a number of assets as part of its activities. This primarily includes drilling rigs in the Upstream segment and retail service
stations, oil depots and storage tanks in the Downstream segment as well as office accommodation and vessel charters across the group. The
weighted-average remaining lease term for the total lease portfolio is around 9 years . Some leases will have payments that vary with market
interest or inflation rates. Certain leases contain residual value guarantees, which may be triggered in certain circumstances such as if market
values have significantly declined at the conclusion of the lease.

Financial results
Sales and other operating revenues in 2019 were lower than in 2018, 
mainly due to lower crude and product prices. 
Replacement cost (RC) profit before interest and tax for 2019 included 
a net non-operating charge of $77 million, which includes environmental 
provisions. The 2018 result included a net non-operating charge of 
$716 million, primarily reflecting restructuring costs. In addition, fair 
value accounting effects had a favourable impact of $160 million, 
compared with a favourable impact of $95 million in 2018. 
After adjusting for non-operating items and fair value accounting effects, 
underlying RC profit before interest and tax in 2019 was $6,419 million.

To deliver our ambition we are reinventing BP, retiring our existing model and replacing it with one that is more focused, more integrated and 
faces the energy transition head on. One that can deliver for the changing demands of consumers, investors and governments.
Our new leadership structure is due to come into place on 1 July 2020 and is expected to be fully operational by 1 January 2021. The new 
leadership will focus on four core capabilities: operations, customers, low carbon and innovation. These four highly focused business groups 
will work with three integrators (sustainability and strategy; regions, cities and solutions; and trading and shipping) to facilitate collaboration 
and unlock value. And four teams will serve as enablers of business delivery. For more information see bp.com/reimagine .

Reinventing BP
On 12 February 2020 we introduced our ambition and aims with a new structure, a new leadership team, and new ways of working.
To deliver our ambition we are reinventing BP, retiring our existing model and replacing it with one that is more focused, more integrated and 
faces the energy transition head on. One that can deliver for the changing demands of consumers, investors and governments.
Our new leadership structure is due to come into place on 1 July 2020 and is expected to be fully operational by 1 January 2021. The new 
leadership will focus on four core capabilities: operations, customers, low carbon and innovation. These four highly focused business groups 
will work with three integrators (sustainability and strategy; regions, cities and solutions; and trading and shipping) to facilitate collaboration 
and unlock value. And four teams will serve as enablers of business delivery. For more information see bp.com/reimagine .
These are the things that every 
energy business needs and are 
critical foundations for what we 
do and how we do it.Partnerships and collaboration
We aim to build enduring relationships with our 
key stakeholders, and partner with others to find 
innovations that can improve efficiency and deliver 
low carbon solutions.
• 20 years of collaboration with the world’s 
top universities.Governance and oversight
Our board has a diversity of knowledge, expertise, 
and ways of thinking that help us transition our 
business, manage risks and continue to deliver 
value over the long term.
• ~42% of the company’s board are women.

•This year we identified the potential impact of climate change and the energy transition as a key audit matter, given
the significant increase in focus on this issue by management and by external stakeholders, and the potential impact
on the financial statements as a consequence.
•In our report for the year ended 31 December 2018 we identified the accounting for acquisitions and disposals
within the upstream segment as a key audit matter, in large part as a consequence of the accounting complexities
surrounding the $10.3 billion acquisition of BHP Billiton assets in the US. During the current year, there were no
material acquisitions and there were fewer significant accounting complexities and judgements in the disposal
transactions undertaken by BP . Accordingly, we did not identify this as a key audit matter for 2019.

impairment charges and tax, and underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.

these businesses to become future BP business units.
Examples of growth businesses in the Launchpad portfolio: 
• Lytt:  a subsurface analytics business, providing fibre optic 
development, deployment and operational services, including 
acoustic and temperature sensing.
• STRYDE:  a land seismic receiver technology business. STRYDE’s

liquidity is sufficient to meet group requirements. It also manages key 
financial risks including interest rate, foreign exchange, pension funding 
and investment, and financial institution credit risk. From locations in 
the UK, US and Singapore, treasury provides the interface between BP 
and the international financial markets and supports the financing of 
BP’s projects around the world. Treasury holds foreign exchange and 
interest rate products in the financial markets to hedge group 
exposures. In addition, treasury generates incremental value through 
optimizing and managing cash flows and the short-term investment of 
operational cash balances. For more information, see Financial 
statements – Note 29.
Insurance
The group generally restricts its purchase of insurance to situations 
where this is required for legal or contractual reasons. Some risks are 
insured with third parties and reinsured by group insurance companies. 
This approach is reviewed on a regular basis or if specific circumstances","Some examples of growth businesses in the Launchpad portfolio include Lytt, a subsurface analytics business specializing in fibre optic development and operational services; STRYDE, a land seismic receiver technology business that generates high-quality seismic images of the subsurface; and Fotech, a technology company focused on advanced fibre optic sensing hardware that BP Ventures has been a minority investor in since 2013."
What does IFRS 16 'Leases' provide?,"the consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ provides a new model for lessee accounting in which the majority of leases will be accounted for by the recognition on the
balance sheet of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The subsequent amortization of the right-of-use asset and the interest expense related
to the lease liability is recognized in profit or loss over the lease term. 
BP elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach in which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognized in opening
retained earnings at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods’ financial information. Comparative information in
the group balance sheet and group cash flow statement has, however, been re-presented to align with current year presentation, showing
lease liabilities and lease liability payments as separate line items. These were previously included within finance debt and repayments of long-
term financing line items respectively. Amounts presented in these line items for the comparative periods relate to leases accounted for as
finance leases under IAS 17 . We do not consider any of the judgements or estimates made on transition to IFRS 16 to be significant. 
IFRS 16 introduces a revised definition of a lease. As permitted by the standard, BP elected not to reassess the existing population of leases
under the new definition and only applies the new definition for the assessment of contracts entered into after the transition date. On
transition the standard permitted, on a lease-by-lease basis, the right-of-use asset to be measured either at an amount equal to the lease
liability (as adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments), or on a historical basis as if the standard had always applied. BP elected to use the
historical asset measurement for its more material leases and used the asset equals liability approach for the remainder of the population. In
measuring the right-of-use asset BP applied the transition practical expedient to exclude initial direct costs. BP also elected to adjust the
carrying amounts of the right-of-use assets as at 1 January 2019 for onerous lease provisions that had been recognized on the group balance
sheet as at 31 December 2018, rather than performing impairment tests on transition.
The effect on the group’s balance sheet is set out further below. The presentation and timing of recognition of charges in the income
statement has changed following the adoption of IFRS 16. The operating lease expense previously reported under IAS 17 , typically on a straight-
line basis, has been replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease liability. In the cash flow statement payments
