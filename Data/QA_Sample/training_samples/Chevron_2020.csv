What actions did Chevron take to protect its long-term health and value during the COVID-19 crisis?,"33

changing environment, there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability around the extent to which the COVID-19 
pandemic will impact our future results, which could be material. 
Chevron entered this crisis well positioned with a strong balance sheet, flexible capital program and low cash flow breakeven 
price. To protect its long-term health and value, the company took swift action, adjusting the items it can control. The 
company lowered its capital expenditures 35 percent and lowered its operating expense, excluding non-recurring severance 
costs, by $1.4 billion compared to 2019. The company completed an enterprise-wide transformation that is expected to 
capture additional cost efficiencies. Additionally, the company suspended its stock repurchase program in March 2020. 
Taken together, these actions are consistent with our financial priorities: to protect the dividend, to prioritize capital spend 
that drives long-term value, and to maintain a strong balance sheet. The company expects to continue to have sufficient 
liquidity and access to both commercial paper and debt capital markets due to its strong balance sheet and investment grade 
credit ratings. Additionally, the company has access to nearly $10 billion in committed credit facilities. 
The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due 
to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower 
tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of 
expected results in future periods. Note 15 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years. 
Refer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” in Part I, 
Item 1A, on pages 18 through 23 of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the inherent 
risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. 
The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term 
value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial 
performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future 
periods. The company’s asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 targeted before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. For the 
three year period ending December 31, 2020, assets sales proceeds totaled $7.7 billion, in the middle of the guidance range.","To protect its long-term health and value, Chevron took swift action during the COVID-19 crisis.

pandemic will impact our future results, which could be material. 
Chevron entered this crisis well positioned with a strong balance sheet, flexible capital program and low cash flow breakeven 
price. To protect its long-term health and value, the company took swift action, adjusting the items it can control. The 
company lowered its capital expenditures 35 percent and lowered its operating expense, excluding non-recurring severance 
costs, by $1.4 billion compared to 2019. The company completed an enterprise-wide transformation that is expected to 
capture additional cost efficiencies. Additionally, the company suspended its stock repurchase program in March 2020. 
Taken together, these actions are consistent with our financial priorities: to protect the dividend, to prioritize capital spend 
that drives long-term value, and to maintain a strong balance sheet. The company expects to continue to have sufficient 
liquidity and access to both commercial paper and debt capital markets due to its strong balance sheet and investment grade 
credit ratings. Additionally, the company has access to nearly $10 billion in committed credit facilities. 
The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due 
to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower 
tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of 
expected results in future periods. Note 15 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years.

Item 1A, on pages 18 through 23 of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the inherent 
risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. 
The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term 
value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial 
performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future

Firstly, the company aims to protect its dividend, ensuring a stable and attractive return to shareholders. Secondly, Chevron prioritizes capital spend that drives long-term value creation, carefully allocating resources to projects and initiatives with the highest potential for sustainable growth and profitability. Lastly, Chevron strives to maintain a strong balance sheet, emphasizing financial stability and flexibility.

What long-term rate of return did the company use for U.S. pension plan assets in 2020?,"For 2020, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.50 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account
for 65 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In both 2019 and 2018, the company used a long-term rate of return of6.75 percent for these plans.
The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on
the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month timeperiod long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous tothe end of the year.

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the increase in benefit obligations was primarily due to 
actuarial losses caused by lower discount rates used to value the obligations.","For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the increase in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial losses caused by lower discount rates used to value the obligations. The benefit obligation for pension benefits at the end of 2020 was $15,166 million for U.S. pensions and $6,307 million for international pensions."
"What was the funded status of the company's pension and OPEB plans at the end of December 31, 2020?","For 2020, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.50 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account
for 65 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In both 2019 and 2018, the company used a long-term rate of return of6.75 percent for these plans.
The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on
the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month timeperiod long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous tothe end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.

How many BOE did the company purchase in 2020?,"In 2020, Extensions and Discoveries of 108 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to portfolio optimizations
where future drilling in various fields is being targeted toward liquids-rich reservoirs with higher execution efficiencies in theMidland and Delaware basins.
The differences in 2020 Extensions and Discoveries of 124 million BOE, between the net quantities of Proved reserves of
247 million BOE as reflected on pages 106 to 109 and net quantities of Proved Undeveloped of 123 million BOE, areprimarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as PUDs in the prior year but rather wererecognized directly as proved developed.
Purchases of 329 million BOE in 2020 include 326 million BOE from the Noble acquisition, primarily in Israel and the DJ
basin in the United States.
Sales of 95 million BOE in 2020 include 77 million BOE from the sale of the company’s interest in Azerbaijan.Transfers to proved developed reserves in 2020 include 178 million BOE in the United States, primarily from the Midland
and Delaware basin developments and 84 million BOE in Canada, Kazakhstan, and other international locations. Thesetransfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.
During 2020, investments totaling approximately $6.3 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in
non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. In Asia,expenditures during the year totaled approximately $3.4 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCOaffiliate in Kazakhstan. The United States accounted for about $2.1 billion related primarily to various development activitiesin the Midland and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico. In Africa, about $0.3 billion was expended on various offshoredevelopment and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada and otherinternational locations were primarily responsible for about $0.5 billion of expenditures.
Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project
development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physicallimitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoirpressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.
At year-end 2020, the company held approximately 1.6 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained","Purchases of 329 million BOE in 2020 include 326 million BOE from the Noble acquisition, primarily in Israel and the DJ basin in the United States."
