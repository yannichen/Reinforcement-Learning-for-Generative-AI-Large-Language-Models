The Global Deal initiative is a multi-stakeholder partnership that promotes social dialogue and decent work worldwide, and TOTAL's participation reflects their dedication to these principles."
What is TOTAL's approach to limiting the environmental footprint of its sites?,"at a site op
erated by a Group entity or nearby is one of the most closely 
monitored risks in view of the potential consequences. New facility construction projects comply with international technical standards from the design stage in order to limit exposure. For production sites operated by a Group entity and subject to this risk, the One MAESTRO reference framework sets out the prevention process in several stages. First, hazardous products such as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMR) chemicals are listed and their risks identified. Second, potential exposure to levels that may present a risk to the health of personnel, contractors or local residents at the site or nearby are identified and assessed, and prevention or attenuation measures are implemented in order to control the risk. Lastly, the approach is checked (atmospheric checks, specific medical monitoring, audits etc.) in order to verify its effectiveness and implement improvement measures if necessary. This is also set out formally in a risk assessment file, which is revised regularly by the Subsidiary.
Limiting the environmental footprint of the Group’s sites
TOTAL implements a policy of avoiding, reducing, managing and monitoring the environmental footprint of its operations. As part of  this policy, emissions are identified and quantified by environment  (water, air and soil) so that appropriate measures can be taken to better control them.
Water, air
The Group’s operations generate discharges such as smokes from combustion plants, emissions into the air from the various conversion processes and discharges of wastewater. In addition to complying with applicable legislation, TOTAL has drawn up rules and guidelines that the Group’s Subsidiaries can use to limit the quantities discharged. TOTAL has set itself targets for reducing sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions and is 
committed to limiting its hydrocarbon discharges into water. After analysis, the exposed sites can introduce various reduction systems that include organizational measures (such as using predictive models to control peaks in sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions based on weather forecast 
data and the improvement of combustion process management, etc.) and technical measures (wastewater treatment plants, using low NO
X 
burners and electrostatic scrubbers, etc.). To date, all refineries wholly owned by the Group have this type of system.
For new facilities developed by the Group, the internal rules require 
impact a
ssessments to be carried out and, if necessary, actions must  
be taken to limit the impact of these emissions.
Soil
The risks of soil pollution related to TOTAL ’s operations come mainly   
from accidental spills and waste storage. TOTAL has drawn up a guide that the Subsidiaries can use to prevent and contain this pollution.  
The recommended approach is based on four pillars:– preventing leaks, by implementing, as far as possible, industry best practice","TOTAL implements a policy of avoiding, reducing, managing, and monitoring the environmental footprint of its operations."

Limiting the environmental footprint of the Group’s sites
TOTAL implements a policy of avoiding, reducing, managing and monitoring the environmental footprint of its operations. As part of  this policy, emissions are identified and quantified by environment  (water, air and soil) so that appropriate measures can be taken to better control them.
Water, air
The Group’s operations generate discharges such as smokes from combustion plants, emissions into the air from the various conversion processes and discharges of wastewater. In addition to complying with applicable legislation, TOTAL has drawn up rules and guidelines that the Group’s Subsidiaries can use to limit the quantities discharged. TOTAL has set itself targets for reducing sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions and is 
committed to limiting its hydrocarbon discharges into water. After analysis, the exposed sites can introduce various reduction systems that include organizational measures (such as using predictive models to control peaks in sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions based on weather forecast 
data and the improvement of combustion process management, etc.) and technical measures (wastewater treatment plants, using low NO
X 
burners and electrostatic scrubbers, etc.). To date, all refineries wholly owned by the Group have this type of system.
For new facilities developed by the Group, the internal rules require 
impact a
ssessments to be carried out and, if necessary, actions must  
be taken to limit the impact of these emissions.
Soil

was 1,967 kb/d compared to 1,959 kb/d at year-end 2019 and 2,021 kb/d at year-end 2018. The Refining & Chemicals segment managed a  
refining capacity of 1,950 kb/d at year-end 2020, or 99% of the Group’s total capacity

The Group’s petrochemicals operations are located in Europe, the  
Unit

majority of its sites either adjacent to or connected by pipelines to Group refineries, TOTAL ’s petrochemical operations are closely integrated with its refining operations, thereby maximizing synergies.
In Europe, the Group keeps reducing its production capacities. The

of the former oil refinery into a platform focusing on new energies.  
In July 2020, TOTAL signed an agreement to sell the company that   
owns the Lindsey refinery and associated assets in the United Kingdom. 
TOTAL also announced in September 2020 the conversion of its Grandpuits refinery in the Paris region into a zero-crude platform, thanks to an investment totaling more than €500 million. The converted site  
will focus on four new industrial activities: the production of renewable diesel primarily intended for the aviation industry, the production of bioplastics, plastics recycling, and the operation of two photovoltaic

was 1,967 kb/d compared to 1,959 kb/d at year-end 2019 and 2,021 kb/d at year-end 2018. The Refining & Chemicals segment managed a

Changes in the Group’s headcount
The number of employees fell by 2.1% (2,300 employees) between 2019 
to 2020. This decrease is mainly due to the adequate management of recruitments. In 2020, 9,354 employees were hired on a permanent contract within the consolidated scope, a decrease of 36% compared to 2019. Indeed, in view of the global economic crisis in 2020, TOTAL chose to capitalize on its existing strengths in order to weather the storm. To maintain cost discipline — a pillar of its efforts to respond to the crisis — the Group largely narrowed its hiring; industries that are driving the Group’s transformation, such as new energies and digital technology, keeping more to secure TOTAL ’s future. In particular, TOTAL hires experienced candidates for positions requiring key skills, offering them long-term career prospects within the Group.
The variations in the breakdown by region and by business segment are 
mainly du
e to changes in the consolidated scope with the exit of some 
SunPower subsidiaries (more than 5,000 employees mainly in Mexico and Asia-Pacific) and the entry of a Marketing & Services subsidiary in Saudi Arabia and a German subsidiary in Refining & Chemicals, representing more than 3,500 employees.

Changes in the Group’s headcount
The number of employees fell by 2.1% (2,300 employees) between 2019 
to 2020. This decrease is mainly due to the adequate management of recruitments. In 2020, 9,354 employees were hired on a permanent contract within the consolidated scope, a decrease of 36% compared to 2019. Indeed, in view of the global economic crisis in 2020, TOTAL chose to capitalize on its existing strengths in order to weather the storm. To maintain cost discipline — a pillar of its efforts to respond to the crisis — the Group largely narrowed its hiring; industries that are driving the Group’s transformation, such as new energies and digital technology, keeping more to secure TOTAL ’s future. In particular, TOTAL hires experienced candidates for positions requiring key skills, offering them long-term career prospects within the Group.
The variations in the breakdown by region and by business segment are 
mainly du
e to changes in the consolidated scope with the exit of some 
SunPower subsidiaries (more than 5,000 employees mainly in Mexico and Asia-Pacific) and the entry of a Marketing & Services subsidiary in Saudi Arabia and a German subsidiary in Refining & Chemicals, representing more than 3,500 employees.
