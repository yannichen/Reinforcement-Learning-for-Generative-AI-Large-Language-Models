What triggers the recognition of impairment loss in accordance with IAS 36?,"impairment loss may be recognised in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets ”. The carrying amounts of long-lived assets are reviewed 
periodically in order to assess whether the recoverable amounts have declined below the carrying amounts. These assets are tested for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their recorded carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When such a decline has 
occurred, the carrying amount is reduced to recoverable amount. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated annually. The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and the value in use. It is difficult to precisely estimate selling price because quoted market prices for 
the Group ’s assets or cash-generating units are not readily available. In determining the value in use, expected cash flows generated by the asset or 
the cash-generating units are discounted to their present value, which requires significant judgement relating to level of sale volume, selling price, 
amount of operating costs and discount rate. Management uses all readily available information in determining an amount that is a reasonable 
approximation of recoverable amount, including estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of sale volume, selling 
price, amount of operating costs and discount rate.
Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment, other than oil and gas properties, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets, after taking into account the estimated residual value. Management reviews the estimated useful lives of the assets at least annually in order 
to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful lives are based on the Group ’s historical 
experience with similar assets and take into account anticipated technological changes. The depreciation expense for future periods is adjusted if 
there are significant changes from previous estimates.
Measurement of expected credit losses
The Group measures and recognises expected credit losses, considering reasonable and supportable information about the relevant past events, 
current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Group regularly monitors and reviews the assumptions used for estimating 
expected credit losses.
Allowance for diminution in value of inventories
If the costs of inventories become higher than their net realisable values, an allowance for diminution in value of inventories is recognised. Net 
realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated",A decline in the recoverable amount below the carrying amount of long-lived assets triggers the recognition of impairment loss in accordance with IAS 36. This occurs when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

What is the method used to depreciate the cost of fixed assets other than oil and gas properties?,"Other than oil and gas properties, the cost of fixed assets less residual value and accumulated impairment losses is depreciated using the 
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, unless the fixed asset is classified as held for sale. The estimated useful lives and the 
estimated rate of residual values adopted for respective classes of fixed assets are as follows:
Estimated Estimated rate
useful life of residual value
Plants and buildings 12-50 years 3%
Equipment, machinery and others 4-30 years 3%
Useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at least each year end.
(8) Oil and gas properties
Oil and gas properties include the mineral interests in properties, wells and related support equipment arising from oil and gas exploration and 
production activities.
The acquisition cost of mineral interest is capitalised as oil and gas properties. Costs of development wells and related support equipment are 
capitalised. The cost of exploratory wells is initially capitalised as construction in progress pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. Exploratory well costs are charged to expenses upon the determination that the well has not found proved reserves. However, 
in the absence of a determination of the discovery of proved reserves, exploratory well costs are not carried as an asset for more than one 
year following completion of drilling. If, after one year has passed, a determination of the discovery of proved reserves cannot be made, the exploratory well costs are impaired and charged to expense. All other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, are charged 
to profit or loss in the year as incurred.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The objective of market risk management is 
to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
(a) Currency risk
Currency risk arises on financial instruments that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured. 
The Group ’s currency risk exposure primarily relates to short-term and long-term debts denominated in USD and lease liabilities denominated in 
SGD. The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risk exposure.
Included primarily in short-term and long-term debts and lease liabilities are the following amounts denominated in a currency other than the 
functional currency of the entity to which they relate:

What guidelines exist for designating estimated oil and gas reserves as 'proved'?,"Engineering estimates of the Group ’s oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the 
subjective judgements involved in developing such information. There are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have 
to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as “proved ”. Proved and proved developed reserves estimates are updated 
at least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved and proved developed reserves also changes. This change is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in related depreciation rates. Oil and gas reserves have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of oil and gas properties reported in the financial statements. If proved reserves 
estimates are revised downwards, the Group ’s earnings could be affected by changes in depreciation expense or an immediate write-down of the 
carrying amount of oil and properties.
Future dismantlement costs for oil and gas properties are estimated with reference to engineering estimates after taking into consideration 
the anticipated method of dismantlement required in accordance with industry practices in the similar geographic area, including estimation of economic life of oil and gas properties, technology and price level. The present values of these estimated future dismantlement costs are 
capitalised as oil and gas properties with equivalent amounts recognised as provisions for dismantlement costs.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense, impairment 
expense and future dismantlement costs. Capitalised costs of proved oil and gas properties are amortised on a unit-of-production method based 
on volumes produced and reserves.
(b) Impairment for assets
If circumstances indicate that the net book value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, the asset may be considered “impaired ”, and 
an impairment loss may be recognised in accordance with “CASs 8 – Impairment of Assets ”. The carrying amounts of long-lived assets are 
reviewed periodically in order to assess whether the recoverable amounts have declined below the carrying amounts. These assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their recorded carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When such a 
decline has occurred, the carrying amount is reduced to recoverable amount. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated annually.
