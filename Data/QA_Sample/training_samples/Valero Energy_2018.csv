increases in corn related co-product prices along with the revenue contribution associated with three ethanol plants acquired from Green
Plains, Inc. (Green Plains) on November 15, 2018, which is described in 
Note 2
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This
increase is partially offset by lower ethanol prices. This improvement in ethanol segment revenue was more than offset by higher cost

What is the sulphur limit for marine fuel set by the IMO in 2020?,"content of no more than 0.50 percent beginning in January 2020, versus the current sulphur limit of 3.50 percent. While there are many
uncertainties, IMO 2020 could affect our business by creating the continued need for new and updated process units necessary to
produce the low sulphur marine fuel, and could increase the costs of our products.
In addition, in 2015, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the
creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the U.S. in April 2016, requires countries to review and
“represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set GHG emission reduction goals) every five
years beginning in 2020. While the current U.S. administration announced its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in June
2017, under the agreement’s terms the earliest the U.S. can withdraw is 2020. There are no guarantees that the agreement will not be re-
implemented in the U.S., or re-implemented in part by specific U.S. states or local governments. However, the Paris Agreement could
still affect our operations in Canada, the U.K., Ireland, and Latin America. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that
have been or may be imposed in various U.S. states, at the U.S. federal level, or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas
industry.
Severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.
Some members within the scientific community believe that the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the Earth’s
atmosphere, among other reasons, may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and
severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such climatic events were to occur, they could have an adverse
effect on our assets and operations.
Compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Renewable Fuel Standard could adversely affect our performance.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) pursuant to the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable
fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into

purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program.","The sulphur limit for marine fuel set by the IMO in 2020 was 0.50 percent, a significant reduction from the previous limit of 3.50 percent."

are used in our refining operations. During the years ended 
December 31, 2018
 and 
2017
, we recognized capital lease assets and

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Operating Leases
We have long-term operating lease commitments for land and office facilities; time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels
(i.e., marine transportation assets); railcars; facilities and equipment related to industrial gases and power used in our operations;
machinery and equipment used in our refining and ethanol operations; and various facilities and equipment used in the storage,
transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstock, refined petroleum product and corn inventories.
In addition to minimum lease payments, some arrangements contain provisions for contingent lease payments. Certain leases for the
storage and transportation of feedstock and refined petroleum products provide for contingent lease payments based on throughput
volumes in excess of a base amount, while other leases for time charters of ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels contain payment
provisions that are

contingent on usage. Additionally, rental increases that are not scheduled in the lease are considered contingent lease payments. In most
cases, we expect that in the normal course of business, our leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases.
As of 
December 31, 2018","As of December 31, 2018, the total minimum lease payment for capital lease obligations is $606 million."

What are the key assumptions used to develop actuarial valuations for pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities?,"are included in 
Note 15
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations
We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent
in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and
health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed and described in 
Note 13
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption
represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available
ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated
assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan
assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to
December 31, 2018
 was 9.38
 
percent. The actual return on assets for the years ended 
December 31, 2018
, 
2017
, and 
2016
 was
(5.53)
 percent, 
19.31
 percent, and

 percent, respectively. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported
in our financial statements. The following sensitivity analysis shows the effects on the projected benefit obligation as of

Our LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and our non-LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or","LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value, which means that if the market value is lower than the cost, the inventory is written down to the lower value. Non-LIFO inventories are also carried at the lower of cost or market value. The determination of these values is based on regular evaluations of market conditions and an assessment of the recoverable value of the inventories."
What tax liabilities are imposed on our company by multiple jurisdictions?,"unable to fully realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash
flows.
Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance
.
We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty,
sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws
and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in
increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing
authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.
On December 22, 2017, tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform) was enacted. Among
other things, Tax Reform reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 
35
 percent to 
21
 percent and implements a new system of
taxation for non-U.S. earnings, including by imposing a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries. Tax Reform also generally will (i) limit our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30 percent of our
“adjusted taxable income” (plus 100 percent of our business interest income) for the year and (ii) permit us to offset only 80 percent
(rather than 100 percent) of our taxable income with any net operating losses we generate after 2017. We have evaluated the effects of
Tax Reform, including the one-time deemed repatriation tax and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the
provisions of Tax Reform, taken as a whole, did not have an adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, or financial
condition. We have used reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying Tax Reform, but it is possible that the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and
assumptions, which could adversely impact our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, and financial condition.
We may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions
.
We currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. If the instruments we use to
hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. In addition, we may be required to incur additional
costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us.
Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative
reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.","We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes.
