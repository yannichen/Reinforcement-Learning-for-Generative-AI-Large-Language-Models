How does the Group classify their financial assets?,"transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; c) the financial assets have 
been transferred and the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, but 
the Group has not retained control.
On derecognition of other equity instrument investments, the difference between the carrying amounts and the sum of the consideration 
received and any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, is recognised in retained earnings. While 
on derecognition of other financial assets, this difference is recognised in profit or loss.
(b) Financial liabilities
The Group, at initial recognition, classifies financial liabilities as either financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost or 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group ’s financial liabilities are mainly financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, including bills payable, accounts payable, other 
payables, loans and debentures payable, etc. These financial liabilities are initially measured at the amount of their fair value after deducting 
transaction costs and use the effective interest rate method for subsequent measurement.
Where the present obligations of financial liabilities are completely or partially discharged, the Group derecognises these financial liabilities 
or discharged parts of obligations. The differences between the carrying amounts and the consideration received are recognised in profit or 
loss.
(c) Determination of fair value
If there is an active market for financial instruments, the quoted price in the active market is used to measure fair values of the financial 
instruments. If no active market exists for financial instruments, valuation techniques are used to measure fair values. In valuation, the Group adopts valuation techniques that are applicable in the current situation and have sufficient available data and other information to support it, 
and selects input values that are consistent with the asset or liability characteristics considered by market participants in the transaction of 
relevant assets or liabilities, and gives priority to relevant observable input values. Use of unobservable input values where relevant observable input values cannot be obtained or are not practicable.
(d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. At each balance sheet date, the fair value is remeasured. The gain or 
loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting is a method which recognises the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item in the same accounting period, to represent the effect of risk management activities.","The Group classifies their financial assets based on criteria such as whether they are loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets. These classifications determine how the assets are measured and accounted for in the financial statements."
What is the impact of derecognition on other equity instrument investments?,"transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; c) the financial assets have

This reflects the change in value of the investments and adjusts the retained earnings accordingly."

If there is an active market for financial instruments, the quoted price in the active market is used to measure fair values of the financial 
instruments. If no active market exists for financial instruments, valuation techniques are used to measure fair values. In valuation, the Group adopts valuation techniques that are applicable in the current situation and have sufficient available data and other information to support it, 
and selects input values that are consistent with the asset or liability characteristics considered by market participants in the transaction of 
relevant assets or liabilities, and gives priority to relevant observable input values. Use of unobservable input values where relevant observable input values cannot be obtained or are not practicable.
(d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. At each balance sheet date, the fair value is remeasured. The gain or 
loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting is a method which recognises the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item in the same accounting period, to represent the effect of risk management activities.","Financial liabilities are initially measured by the Group at the fair value of the consideration received, after deducting any transaction costs. Subsequently, the liabilities are measured using the effective interest rate method, which takes into account the contractual cash flows and any changes in the carrying amount of the liabilities."
What valuation techniques does the Group use to determine fair value?,"transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; c) the financial assets have 
been transferred and the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, but 
the Group has not retained control.
On derecognition of other equity instrument investments, the difference between the carrying amounts and the sum of the consideration 
received and any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, is recognised in retained earnings. While 
on derecognition of other financial assets, this difference is recognised in profit or loss.
(b) Financial liabilities
The Group, at initial recognition, classifies financial liabilities as either financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost or 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group ’s financial liabilities are mainly financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, including bills payable, accounts payable, other 
payables, loans and debentures payable, etc. These financial liabilities are initially measured at the amount of their fair value after deducting 
transaction costs and use the effective interest rate method for subsequent measurement.
Where the present obligations of financial liabilities are completely or partially discharged, the Group derecognises these financial liabilities 
or discharged parts of obligations. The differences between the carrying amounts and the consideration received are recognised in profit or 
loss.

Hedge accounting is a method which recognises the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument

If there is an active market, the quoted price in that market is used as the fair value. If there is no active market, the Group uses valuation techniques that consider relevant observable input values and available data to determine fair value. This ensures that the fair value reflects the asset or liability characteristics as valued by market participants."
What is hedge accounting and how does it affect profit or loss?,"transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; c) the financial assets have 
been transferred and the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, but

By using hedge accounting, any gains or losses on the hedging instrument and the hedged item that offset each other are recognized in profit or loss, resulting in a more accurate depiction of the financial performance related to the hedged risk."
What was the operating revenue of the refining and chemical production segment in 2020?,"the Company ’s refining and chemical 
production. Most of the natural gas and 
a small portion of crude oil were sold 
externally to other customers.
In 2020, the operating revenues of 
this segment was RMB 167.8 billion, representing a decrease of 20.4% over 
2019. This was mainly attributed to the 
decrease of realised price in crude oil, natural gas and LNG.
In 2020, the segment sold 34.52 million 
tonnes of crude oil, representing an 
increase of 0.5% over 2019. Natural
