How does the company assign the differences between the carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate?,"Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the
affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the variousfactors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjustedquarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.
Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are
presented separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income
attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement ofIncome and Consolidated Statement of Equity.
Fair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value
of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for theasset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.
Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial
risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently
occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivativeinstruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not applyhedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’scommodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company mayenter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt.Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges.Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains andlosses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payableamounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.
Inventories Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out
method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at
cost or net realizable value.","Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values."
Where are the ownership interests in the company's subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet?,"Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the

Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial
risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently
occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivativeinstruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not applyhedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income.

What technologies were used in establishing the additions to Chevron's proved reserves in 2019?,"RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities.
These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with theChevron Corporation Reserves Manual .
Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2019, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based
on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire linesampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regionalgeologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves At the end of 2019, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 4.0 billion barrels of oil-equivalent
(BOE), a decrease of 641 million BOE from year-end 2018. The decrease was due to 685 million BOE in revisions, the
transfer of 593 million BOE to proved developed and 31 million BOE in sales, partially offset by 635 million BOE inextensions and discoveries, 26 million BOE in acquisitions and 7 million BOE in improved recovery. A major portion of thereserves revisions are attributed to the company’s decision to reduce planned developments and evaluate strategicalternatives, including divestment scenarios for its acreage in the Appalachian region.
During 2019, investments totaling approximately $10.5 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in
non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. In Asia,expenditures during the year totaled approximately $5.3 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCOaffiliate in Kazakhstan. The United States accounted for about $3.3 billion related primarily to various development activitiesin the Gulf of Mexico and the Midland and Delaware basins. In Africa, about $0.5 billion was expended on various offshoredevelopment and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada, Braziland Argentina were primarily responsible for about $1.0 billion of expenditures in Other Americas.
Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project","In 2019, Chevron used a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies to establish the additions to its proved reserves. These technologies included well logs, wireline sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, core analysis, seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs.

What are crude oil and natural gas reserves?,"44

Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and
expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and
gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the futureunder existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developedand undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wellswith existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered fromnew wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required forrecompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include fieldperformance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs.
The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and
to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated FinancialStatements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
1. Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production
(UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOPbasis using total proved reserves. During 2019, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization(DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $14.2 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2019were 6.3 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOPcalculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOPDD&A in 2019 would have increased by approximately $700 million.
2. Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A
significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Provedreserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumesin the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairmentassessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.","Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in Chevron's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Firstly, the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important for the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred. This is because certain asset and expense accounts in the financial statements are affected by these reserves. Additionally, the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets is dependent on the estimates of reserves. The successful efforts method of accounting used by Chevron includes capitalizing and amortizing exploratory drilling and development costs based on proved developed reserves. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property can trigger an impairment review, which is also relevant to Chevron's financial statements."

inflows and outflows.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Time Deposits Total balances were $5.7 billion and $10.3 billion at
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $27.3 billion, compared to
$30.6 billion in 2018, primarily due to lower crude oil prices. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributionsto employee pension plans of approximately $1.4 billion in 2019 and $1.0 billion in 2018. Cash provided by investingactivities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.8 billion in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018.
Restricted cash of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was held in cash and short-term
marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” onthe Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, taxpayments, funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and refundable deposits related to pending asset sales.
Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $9.0 billion in 2019 and $8.5 billion in 2018.
Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Total debt and finance lease liabilities were $27.0 billion at December 31, 2019, down
from $34.5 billion at year-end 2018.The $7.5 billion decrease in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2019 was primarily due to the repayment of long-
term notes totaling $5.0 billion as they matured during 2019, and a reduction in commercial paper. The company’s debt andfinance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations andthe current portion of long-term debt, totaled $13.0 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $15.6 billion at year-end2018. Of these amounts, $9.75 billion and $9.9 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2019 and 2018,respectively.
