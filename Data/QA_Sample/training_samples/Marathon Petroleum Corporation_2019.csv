What risks and uncertainties does MPC face following the Andeavor acquisition?,"MPC’s results may suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the
Andeavor acquisition.
MPC’s success depends, in part, on its ability to manage its expansion following the Andeavor acquisition,
which poses numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate the operations and business ofAndeavor into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine systems and managementcontrols and to integrate relationships with customers, vendors and business partners.
MPC may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Andeavor acquisition.The success of the Andeavor acquisition depends, in part, on MPC’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits
and cost savings from combining MPC’s and Andeavor’s businesses, including the annual gross, run-rate,commercial and corporate synergies that MPC expects to realize within the first three years after thecombination. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Andeavor acquisition may not be realized fullyor at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may require more non-recurring costs and expenditures torealize than expected or could have other adverse effects. There could be potential unknown liabilities andunforeseen expenses associated with the Andeavor acquisition that were not discovered in the course ofperforming due diligence.
We have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become further impaired and result
in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.
We accounted for the Andeavor and other acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which
requires that the assets and liabilities of the acquired business be recorded to our balance sheet at theirrespective fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair valueof the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill.
As of December 31, 2019, our balance sheet reflected $20.0 billion and $3.0 billion of goodwill and other
intangible assets, respectively. These amounts include goodwill and other intangible assets of $17.3 billionand $2.8 billion, respectively, recognized in connection with the Andeavor acquisition. As a part of our annualimpairment review for goodwill, MPLX recorded approximately $1.2 billion of impairment expense in thefourth quarter of 2019. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes further impaired, wemay be required to incur additional material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. Our operatingresults may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business thattriggered the impairment.

This impairment expense was a result of the annual impairment review for goodwill. If the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes further impaired, MPC may be required to incur additional material non-cash charges related to such impairment."
How might meeting the requirements of evolving environmental or other laws and regulations impact MPC's operations?,"MPC’s results may suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the
Andeavor acquisition.
MPC’s success depends, in part, on its ability to manage its expansion following the Andeavor acquisition,
which poses numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate the operations and business ofAndeavor into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine systems and managementcontrols and to integrate relationships with customers, vendors and business partners.
MPC may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Andeavor acquisition.The success of the Andeavor acquisition depends, in part, on MPC’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits
and cost savings from combining MPC’s and Andeavor’s businesses, including the annual gross, run-rate,commercial and corporate synergies that MPC expects to realize within the first three years after thecombination. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Andeavor acquisition may not be realized fullyor at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may require more non-recurring costs and expenditures torealize than expected or could have other adverse effects. There could be potential unknown liabilities andunforeseen expenses associated with the Andeavor acquisition that were not discovered in the course ofperforming due diligence.
We have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become further impaired and result
in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.

This impact may involve additional costs and resources needed to comply with the new requirements. MPC will need to adapt and adjust its operations to remain compliant and mitigate any potential risks or negative effects from non-compliance. The impact will largely depend on the specific nature and extent of the new laws and regulations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and
commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Someof these matters are discussed below. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuitsor proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and ourexperience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or inthe aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financialposition or cash flows.
SEC MatterWe have been cooperating with the staff of the SEC in connection with a formal investigation regarding
Andeavor’s historical share repurchase activity and an informal investigation regarding MPC’s sharerepurchase activity. The staff of the SEC has indicated that it intends to recommend an action with respect toAndeavor’s historical share repurchase activity. We will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC staff inconnection with these matters. We are unable to predict the outcome or impact of these investigations on ourconsolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
46Litigation
In May 2015, the Kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Marathon
Petroleum Company LP (“MPC LP”), in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentuckyasserting claims under federal and state antitrust statutes, the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act, and statecommon law. The complaint, as amended in July 2015, alleges that MPC LP used deed restrictions, supplyagreements with customers and exchange agreements with competitors to unreasonably restrain trade in areaswithin Kentucky and seeks declaratory relief, unspecified damages, civil penalties, restitution anddisgorgement of profits. At this stage, the ultimate outcome of this litigation remains uncertain, and neitherthe likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability, if any, can be determined, and we areunable to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or range of loss) for this matter. We intend to vigorously defendourselves in this matter.
Environmental ProceedingsGovernmental and other entities in California, New York, Maryland and Rhode Island have filed lawsuits","Yes, governmental and other entities in California, New York, Maryland, and Rhode Island have filed lawsuits related to environmental matters against the company."
