What is the amortization method used for land use rights and patents?,"(13)  Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Intangible assets include land use rights and patents, etc., and are initially recorded at cost. The intangible assets 
injected by the state-owned shareholder during the Restructuring were initially recorded at the valued amount approved 
by the relevant authorities managing the state-owned assets.
Land use rights are amortised using the straight-line method over 30 to 50 years. If it is impracticable to allocate 
the amount paid for the purchase of land use rights and buildings between the land use rights and the buildings on a reasonable basis, the entire amount is accounted for as fixed assets. 
Patent and other intangible assets are initially recorded at actual cost, and amortised using the straight-line method 
over their estimated useful lives. 
The carrying amount of intangible assets is written down to its recoverable amount when the recoverable amount is 
lower than the carrying amount (Note 4(16)). The estimated useful years and amortisation method of the intangible assets 
with finite useful life are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year-end.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the identifiable net assets of the acquiree under a business combination not involving entities under common control.
