Saudi Aramco  Annual Report 2020  |  AramcoDear Shareholders,
In 2020, no industry or company was 
immune to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic — including ours.
Aramco, for its part, demonstrated 
considerable financial and widespread operational agility during the most volatile year the world has seen in generations. With the majority of our 
employees working in field locations, we 
proactively put in place comprehensive protective measures to safeguard their safety and well-being, while maintaining our operational integrity and reliability. 
With COVID-19 making daily work and 
life more complex, we benefited from having previously adopted advanced technology and building a robust IT infrastructure — all of which allowed 
us to adjust quickly and enabled our 
employees who could work remotely, 
to do so. 
As part of the battle against COVID-19, we provided support for Saudi Arabia’s healthcare sector, including donating ventilators and other medical equipment and supplies. Our affiliates in Asia, Europe, and North America also engaged in similar initiatives.
Maintaining financial resilience 
Despite the economic fallout of the pandemic, we declared a dividend 
of SAR 281 billion ($75 billion) to our 
shareholders for the year.","The independent director that replaced Andrew Gould on the Board is Mark Weinberger, former EY Global Chairman and CEO."

In September 2019, the IASB amended IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, which modify some specific hedge accounting requirements to provide relief from potential effects of the uncertainty caused by the IBOR reform in which the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) interest benchmark will cease after 2021.

• Financial Liabilities: SAR 874
Saudi Aramco uses financial instruments as part of its risk management strategy to manage exposures arising from variation of interest rates that could affect net income or other comprehensive income and applies hedge accounting to these instruments. Saudi Aramco has certain borrowings where the reference rate is linked to LIBOR. Saudi Aramco is establishing a transition plan that follows a risk management approach to ensure a smooth transition to alternative reference rates. There is no material impact on Saudi Aramco’s

As one of the world’s largest integrated

9.8 billion inhabitants by 2050, according 
to the United Nations.While the energy system is constantly growing and evolving, Aramco believes the transition to a lower carbon system will continue to require hydrocarbon-based resources for many years.

near-term. With existing infrastructure

trade agreements. Foreign countries may take such measures for political or other reasons, including reasons unrelated
