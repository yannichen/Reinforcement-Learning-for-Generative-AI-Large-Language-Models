What is the accounting treatment for credit-impaired financial assets?,"effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is adjusted, with the amount of the impairment gain or loss recognized in the income
statement.
A financial asset or group of financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost is considered to be credit-impaired if there is reasonable
and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset (or
group of financial assets) have occurred. Financial assets are written off where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering amounts
due.
Financial liabilities
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as follows:
Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities are
carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as
effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge
These derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluation is described below in
the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
All other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and
borrowings this is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized
cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the
repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.
This category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and finance debt.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates
and commodity prices, as well as for trading purposes. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on
which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is
positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.

Corporate governance practices
In the US, BP ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE). The significant differences between BP’s corporate
governance practices as a UK company and those required by NYSE
listing standards for US companies are listed as follows:
Independence
BP has adopted a robust set of board governance principles, which
reflect the UK Corporate Governance Code approach to corporate
governance. As such, the way in which BP makes determinations of
directors’ independence differs from the NYSE rules. 
BP’s board governance principles require that all non-executive
directors be determined by the board to be ‘independent in character
and judgement and free from any business or other relationship
which could materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement’.
The BP board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the non-
executive directors are independent. In doing so, however, the board
did not explicitly take into consideration the independence
requirements outlined in the NYSE’s listing standards.
Committees
BP has a number of board committees that are broadly comparable in
purpose and composition to those required by NYSE rules for
domestic US companies. For instance, BP has a chairman’s (rather
than executive) committee and remuneration (rather than
compensation) committee. BP also has an audit committee, which
NYSE rules require for both US companies and foreign private
issuers. These committees are composed solely of non-executivedirectors whom the board has determined to be independent, in the
manner described above. 
The BP board governance principles prescribe the composition, main
tasks and requirements of each of the committees (see the board
committee reports on pages 75-86 ). BP has not, therefore, adopted
separate charters for each committee. 
Under US securities law and the listing standards of the NYSE, BP is
required to have an audit committee that satisfies the requirements
of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Section 303A.06 of the
NYSE Listed Company Manual. BP’s audit committee complies with",The significance of the subsidiaries of the group at 31 December 2018 is detailed in the Financial statements - Note 37.

What is the ratio of the group chief executive's total remuneration to the median pay in 2018?,"the annual bonus. For a more immediate impact, BP is also encouraging more ‘in the moment’ feedback through our new global recognition programme ‘energize!’, introduced in 2018. Energize! has been well received in all business areas and locations, with 77% of employees recognized at least once, at a frequency of around 1,500 recognition moments every day by year end.
With strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion to create teams that 
reflect their communities, and with the enduring foundation of BP’s values and behaviours to build respect, we believe BP employees work in a supportive, meritocratic and progressive environment. This positive environment is reflected in being the highest-ranked UK recruiter in the oil and gas sector in the Times newspaper’s Top 100 Graduate Employer rankings 2018.

98Corporate governanceDirectors’ remuneration report Equal pay and UK gender pay gap reporting
As well as looking at pay structures, the committee has spent time 
understanding how effectively current pay policies and processes manage fairness and avoid bias in pay outcomes. We noted the February 2018 UK gender pay gap reporting for the five legal entities covered by the regulations, and the explanations provided in the narrative that accompanied BP’s reporting.
Overall the committee feels assured that the anti-discrimination  
controls written into pay policies, and the quality of processes behind 
individual pay decision making, are effective in delivering an equal pay environment (like pay for like work) for the wider workforce. While the UK gender pay gap reporting showed pay gaps in favour of men for four out of the five entities, we understand that these gaps result largely from the relative under-representation of women in senior roles, and that the group’s primary focus should therefore be on improving female representation, rather than adjusting pay practices. Therefore we have reviewed the various initiatives taken by management to address these representation concerns and will continue to monitor progress in addressing the underlying issues.The illustration below, from our 2018 UK gender pay gap reporting, highlights the representation issue and how it relates to the gender pay gap for each entity. For instance, our larger gender pay gaps relate to BP Exploration and BP p.l.c. where we have the largest differential between female representation in the top and bottom pay quartiles. By contrast, we reported a negative pay gap in BP Chemicals, where male to female representation is more consistent.

BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018
98Corporate governanceDirectors’ remuneration report Equal pay and UK gender pay gap reporting
As well as looking at pay structures, the committee has spent time 
understanding how effectively current pay policies and processes manage fairness and avoid bias in pay outcomes. We noted the February 2018 UK gender pay gap reporting for the five legal entities covered by the regulations, and the explanations provided in the narrative that accompanied BP’s reporting.
Overall the committee feels assured that the anti-discrimination  
controls written into pay policies, and the quality of processes behind 
individual pay decision making, are effective in delivering an equal pay environment (like pay for like work) for the wider workforce. While the UK gender pay gap reporting showed pay gaps in favour of men for four out of the five entities, we understand that these gaps result largely from the relative under-representation of women in senior roles, and that the group’s primary focus should therefore be on improving female representation, rather than adjusting pay practices. Therefore we have reviewed the various initiatives taken by management to address these representation concerns and will continue to monitor progress in addressing the underlying issues.The illustration below, from our 2018 UK gender pay gap reporting, highlights the representation issue and how it relates to the gender pay gap for each entity. For instance, our larger gender pay gaps relate to BP Exploration and BP p.l.c. where we have the largest differential between female representation in the top and bottom pay quartiles. By contrast, we reported a negative pay gap in BP Chemicals, where male to female representation is more consistent.
Men WomenProportion of females and males in each quartile bandThese charts show how men and women are represented in each pay band.  
An even distribution across the quartiles would tend to minimize the gender pay gap.
BP p.l.c. predominantly covers employees in corporate  
business and functions, including our integrated  
supply and trading and Air BP businesses.BP p.l.c.
