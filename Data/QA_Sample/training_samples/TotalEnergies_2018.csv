What are TOTAL's main areas of focus for investment and development?,"and concentrating investments on large integrated platforms; 
— developing petrochemicals in the United States and the Middle East by exploiting the proximity of cost- effective oil and gas 
resources in order to supply growing markets, in particular Asia; and 
— innovating in low carbon activities by developing biofuels, biopolymers and plastics recycling solutions as well as materials contributing to the energy efficiency of the Group’s customers,

2.3.1.1 Reﬁning and petrochemicals 
TOTAL’s refining capacity was 2,021 kb/d as of December 31, 2018, 
same as at year- end 2017 and compared to 2,011 kb/d at year- end 
2016. The Refining & Chemicals segment managed a capacity of 1,993 kb/d at year- end 2018, or 99% of the Group’s total capacity. 
TOTAL has equity stakes in 18 refineries (including nine operated by companies of the Group), located in Europe, the Middle East, the United States, Asia and Africa
(2). 
The petrochemicals businesses are located mainly in Europe, the United States, Qatar, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Most of these sites are either adjacent to or connected by pipelines to Group refineries. As a result, TOTAL’s petrochemical operations 
are 
integrated within its refining operations, thereby maximizing synergies. 
Between 2011 and 2016, the Group reduced its production 
capacities in Europe by 20%, thereby fully meeting the target it had set for 2017. Since then, the major investment project launched in 2013 on the Antwerp platform in Belgium has been completed, with the aim of improving the site’s conversion rate and increasing the flexibility of the steam crackers. The project to transform the La Mède 
refinery into a biorefinery continues.

Financial instruments classified as level 3 in 2018 consist of long-
term liquefied natural gas purchase and sales contracts which relate to the trading activity. 
The composition and size of this portfolio of contracts changed in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of the acquisition of ENGIE’s activities. 
The Group values these contracts on the basis of observable inputs 
on the forward price of natural gas, liquefied natural gas and crude oil and on the basis of internal assumptions for price evolution beyond observable horizon, on price renegotiation terms for long-term contracts and on uncertainties related to the execution of contracts. 
These valuation methods lead to an assessment of the fair value of 
the portfolio of contracts over an effective horizon of two years. 
The description of each fair 
value level is presented in Note 15 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

term liquefied natural gas purchase and sales contracts which relate to the trading activity. 
The composition and size of this portfolio of contracts changed in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of the acquisition of ENGIE’s activities. 
The Group values these contracts on the basis of observable inputs 
on the forward price of natural gas, liquefied natural gas and crude oil and on the basis of internal assumptions for price evolution beyond observable horizon, on price renegotiation terms for long-term contracts and on uncertainties related to the execution of contracts.

What suggestions were made by the Board of Directors to improve its functioning?,"The Board of Directors made the following suggestions that could

At its meeting on December 16, 2015, the Board of Directors decided 
to reunify the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TOTAL S.A. as of December 19, 2015. As a result, since that date, Mr. Pouyanné has held the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TOTAL S.A.

Officer, Mr. de Margerie, the Board of Directors decided, at its meeting on October 22, 2014, to separate the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in order to best ensure the transition of the General Management. The Board of Directors therefore appointed Mr. Pouyanné as Chief Executive Officer for a term of office expiring following the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting called in 2017 to approve the 2016 financial statements 
(1), and Mr. Desmarest as Chairman of 
the Board of Directors for a term of office expiring on December 18, 2015, in accordance with the age limit set out in the bylaws. It was announced that, on that date, the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TOTAL S.A. would be combined. At the Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting of June 1, 2018, Mr. Pouyanné’s directorship was renewed for a period of three years, i.e., until the end of the Shareholders’ Meeting in 2021 that will approve the accounts of fiscal year 2020. On the proposal of the Governance and Ethics Committee, approved by the meeting of the Board of Directors of March 14, 2018, the latter met after the Shareholders’ Meeting and unanimously decided to renew Mr. Pouyanné’s term of office as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for the duration of his directorship. 
At the meeting of the Board of Directors of March 14, 2018, the 
Lead Independent Director notably reiterated that the proposal to continue to combine the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer was made further to work done by the Governance and Ethics Committee in the interests of the Company. In this regard, the unified Management Form was deemed to be most appropriate to the Group’s organization, modus operandi 
and business, and to the specific features of the oil and gas sectors, particularly in light of the advantage for the Group of having a unified management in strategic negotiations with States and the Group’s partners.

On the proposal of the Governance and Ethics Committee, approved by the meeting of the Board of Directors of March 14, 2018, the latter met after the Shareholders’ Meeting and unanimously decided to renew Mr. Pouyanné’s term of office as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for the duration of his directorship. 
At the meeting of the Board of Directors of March 14, 2018, the 
Lead Independent Director notably reiterated that the proposal to continue to combine the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer was made further to work done by the Governance and Ethics Committee in the interests of the Company. In this regard, the unified Management Form was deemed to be most appropriate to the Group’s organization, modus operandi 
and business, and to the specific features of the oil and gas sectors, particularly in light of the advantage for the Group of having a unified management in strategic negotiations with States and the Group’s partners. 
(1) The meeting of the Board of Directors of December 16, 2015, decided to extend the term of this office to the end of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of June 1, 2018, date of expiry of","After the death of TOTAL's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. de Margerie, Mr. Pouyanné was appointed as Chief Executive Officer by the Board of Directors."
When was Mr. Pouyanné's directorship renewed and until when?,"The Board of Directors made the following suggestions that could 
further improve its functioning: 
— consider alternative disruptive scenarios within the framework of 
the strategic consideration; 
— increase opportunities to meet the Group’s executive officers; and 
— prepare the succession plan for key positions among the Board of Directors. 
4.1.5 General Management 
4.1.5.1 Uniﬁed Management Form 
Combination of the management positions 
At its meeting on December 16, 2015, the Board of Directors decided 
to reunify the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TOTAL S.A. as of December 19, 2015. As a result, since that date, Mr. Pouyanné has held the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TOTAL S.A. 
Following the death of TOTAL’s former Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer, Mr. de Margerie, the Board of Directors decided, at its meeting on October 22, 2014, to separate the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in order to best ensure the transition of the General Management. The Board of Directors therefore appointed Mr. Pouyanné as Chief Executive Officer for a term of office expiring following the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting called in 2017 to approve the 2016 financial statements 
(1), and Mr. Desmarest as Chairman of 
the Board of Directors for a term of office expiring on December 18, 2015, in accordance with the age limit set out in the bylaws. It was announced that, on that date, the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TOTAL S.A. would be combined. At the Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting of June 1, 2018, Mr. Pouyanné’s directorship was renewed for a period of three years, i.e., until the end of the Shareholders’ Meeting in 2021 that will approve the accounts of fiscal year 2020.

What monitoring procedures does TOTAL rely on to update the Vigilance Plan?,"3.5.8 Monitoring procedures 
To ensure the continuous updating of the Vigilance Plan, TOTAL relies 
on existing monitoring procedures and tools relating to human rights, safety, health and environment made available to the Subsidiaries. 
Thus, the system of internal reporting and of indicators for monitoring 
implementation of the actions undertaken in the Group in these areas is based: 
— for social indicators (including, in particular, health), on a guide 
entitled “Corporate Social Reporting Protocol and Methodology”; 
— for industrial safety indicators, on a Group rule concerning event and statistical reporting; a feedback analysis process identifies, in 
particular, events 
for which a structured analysis report is re quir
ed 
in order to 
learn lessons in terms of design and operation; and 
— for environmental indicators, on a Group reporting procedure, together with activity- specific instructions. 
Consolidated objectives are defined for each key indicator and reviewed annually . The business segments apply these indicators as 
appropriate to their ar ea of r esponsibility , analyze the r esults and set 
out a plan. 
All of the pr ocedur es 
enable regular monitoring of actions and areas 
for improvement to be implemented in the area of human rights, 
safety, health and environment. The Group Performance Management Committee (refer to point 4.1.5.2 of chapter 4) is involved in this approach. In particular, it is responsible for examining, analyzing and steering the Group’s HSE, 
financial and operational results on a 
quarterly basis. In addition, the committee responsible for monitoring the CSR Global Agreement signed by TOTAL in 2015, known as the “FAIR Committee”, meets every year in the presence of representatives who are members of trade unions affiliated to 
the IndustriALL Global 
Union (refer to points 5.3.3.3 and 5.10.3 of Chapter 5) and appointed by this federation to monitor and implement the agreement. It identifies good practice and areas for 
improvement in the fields of safety, 
health, human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
Additionally, the Group publishes a Human Rights information 
document that describes the Group’s Activities’ major impacts on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the remedial measures taken. In 2016, TOTAL became the first company in the oil industry to have published this document in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. It is available on the Group’s website and was updated in 2018. 
Since 2015, TOTAL also publishes a re port 
to assess the progress 
made in the implementation of the Voluntary Principles on Security 
and Human Rights. The information set out in the report is based on annual reporting organized by the Security Division that brings together the results of the risk and compliance analyses for each subsidiary operating in a sensitive context. 
Lastly, in September 2018 TOTAL published the third edition 
of its","TOTAL relies on existing monitoring procedures and tools, such as the Corporate Social Reporting Protocol and Methodology for social indicators, a Group rule for industrial safety indicators, and a Group reporting procedure for environmental indicators, to update the Vigilance Plan."
