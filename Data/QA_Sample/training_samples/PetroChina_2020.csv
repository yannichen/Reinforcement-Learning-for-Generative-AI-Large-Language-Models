involving assets that constitute a business, as defined in IFRS 3, between the Group and its associate or joint veture is recognised in full in the consolidated financial statement.
A listing of the Group’s principal associates is shown in Note 17.
(c) Investments in joint ventures
Joint ventures are arrangements in which the Group with one or more parties have joint control, whereby the Group

Group’s interests in joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting (Note 3(b)) in the consolidated financial statements. 
A listing of the Group’s principal joint ventures is shown in Note 17.
(d) Transactions with non-controlling interests
Transactions with non-controlling interests are treated as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners of 
the Group. Gains and losses resulting from disposals to non-controlling interests are recorded in equity. The differences 
between any consideration paid and the relevant share of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary acquired resulting from the purchase of non-controlling interests, are recorded in equity.
When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to 
its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.

What are proved developed oil and gas reserves?,"Proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered: 
a. Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required 
equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well.
b. Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the 
extraction is by means not involving a well.
Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on 
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
The taxes, fees and royalty in China are domestic tax schemes and are paid in cash to PRC authorities. The proved 
reserves includes quantities that are ultimately produced and sold to pay these taxes, fees and royalty.
Proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were based on reports prepared by DeGolyer and 
MacNaughton, Gaffney, Cline & Associates, McDaniel & Associates, Ryder Scott and GLJ independent engineering 
consultants. 
Estimated quantities of net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas reserves and of changes in net 
quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves for each of the periods indicated are as follows:FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(All amounts in RMB millions unless otherwise stated)(ac) Changes in significant accouting policies
The Group has initially adopted Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3) and early adopted Sale or 
Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28) from 
1 January 2020. The details of accounting policies are set out in Note 3(a) and 3(b). A number of other new standards are also effective from 1 January 2020 but they do not have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.
4  FINANCIAL RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
4.1 Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
(a) Market risk
Market risk is the possibility that changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and the prices of oil and gas 
products will adversely affect the value of assets, liabilities and expected future cash flows.
(i) Foreign exchange riskThe Group conducts its domestic business primarily in RMB, but maintains a portion of its assets in other currencies 
to pay for imported crude oil, imported equipment and other materials and to meet foreign currency financial liabilities. 
The Group is exposed to currency risks arising from fluctuations in various foreign currency exchange rates against the RMB. The RMB is not a freely convertible currency and is regulated by the PRC government. Limitations on foreign exchange transactions imposed by the PRC government could cause future exchange rates to vary significantly from current or historical exchange rates.","The limitation on foreign exchange transactions imposed by the PRC government can cause significant variations in exchange rates. As the Group conducts its domestic business primarily in RMB but maintains assets in other currencies, these restrictions can affect the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities. The regulated nature of the RMB and limitations on foreign exchange transactions create uncertainty in future exchange rates, which can impact the Group's financial position and results."
