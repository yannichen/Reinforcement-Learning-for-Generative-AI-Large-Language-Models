What contributed to the increase in Midstream segment results in 2018?,"In 2018, Midstream segment income from operations includes $230 million due to contributions from ANDX
and $874 million, from the refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services contributed to MPLX onFebruary 1, 2018. Prior period Midstream segment results do not reflect the impact of these new businesses. Theincremental $309 million increase in Midstream segment results in 2018, was driven by record gathered,processed and fractionated volumes and record pipeline throughput volumes for MPLX.
2017 Compared to 2016
Midstream segment revenue and income from operations increased $675 million and $291 million, respectively,
primarily due to increased revenue from higher natural gas and NGL gathering, processing and fractionationvolumes and changes in natural gas and NGL prices. Segment results also benefited from the first quarter 2017acquisitions of the Ozark pipeline and our ownership interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. The comparison for2017 and 2016 also reflects the absence of any revenues for the terminal services provided to the Refining &Marketing segment in the first quarter of 2016 versus the inclusion of revenues for these services in the firstquarter of 2017. These assets were not considered a business prior to April 1, 2016, and therefore, no financialresults for these assets were available from which to recast first quarter 2016 Midstream segment results.

The 2017 and 2018 RFSvolumes have also been challenged in court.
On November 30, 2018, the EPA finalized RFS volume requirements for the year 2019, and the biomass-based
diesel volume requirement for year 2020. The EPA used its cellulosic waiver authority to reduce the volumes for2019 from the statutory amounts to the following: 19.92 billion gallons total renewable fuel; 4.92 billion gallonsadvanced biofuel; and 418 million gallons cellulosic biofuel. The EPA set the biomass-based diesel volumerequirement for 2020 at 2.43 billion gallons, which is significantly greater than the statutory floor of 1.0 billiongallons.
The RFS2 is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure
constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline (“E10”). Since 2016, thevolume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the E10 blendwall, which willrequire obligated parties to either sell E15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed historical levels or retirecarryover RINs.
We have made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply
with the annually-increasing biodiesel RFS2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined dieselproduct, and by buying needed biodiesel RINs in the EPA-created biodiesel RINs market. On April 1, 2014, wepurchased a facility in Cincinnati, Ohio, which currently produces biodiesel, glycerin and other by-products. As aproducer of biodiesel, we generate RINs, thereby reducing our reliance on the external RIN market.
In November 2017, the EPA finalized its decision to deny petitions requesting that the point of obligation for the
RFS2 be moved to the terminal rack. The EPA’s final decision was challenged in court and should the courtdecide that EPA’s decision was incorrect and move the point of obligation, we could be subject to increased costsand compliance uncertainties.
In addition to federal renewable fuel standards, certain states have, or are considering, promulgation of state
renewable or low carbon fuel standards. For example, California began implementing its Low Carbon FuelStandard (“LCFS”) in January 2011. In September 2015, the CARB approved the re-adoption of the LCFS,which became effective on January 1, 2016, to address procedural deficiencies in the way the original regulationwas adopted. The LCFS was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 20 percent reduction infuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030.","In a legal challenge to the 2014-2016 volumes, the court vacated the total renewable volume for 2016 and remanded to the EPA for reconsideration consistent with the court’s opinion. A remanded rule that increases the 2016 total renewable volume could increase our cost of compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standards and be detrimental to the RIN market."
