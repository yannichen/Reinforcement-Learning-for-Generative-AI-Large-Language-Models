The group also uses management information to monitor credit risk, which reflects the impact of credit enhancements. Additionally, the group recognizes expected credit loss allowances on financial assets based on historical experience and relevant market and academic research, and applies credit enhancements to mitigate credit risk. The maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount, and the group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses."

increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above 
pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this 
would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change’.

temperature goal set out in Article 2, parties aim to reach global 
peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, 
recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country 
parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance 
with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between 
anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of 
greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of 
equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to 
eradicate poverty.

temperature goal set out in Article 2, parties aim to reach global 
peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, 
recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country 
parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance 
with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between 
anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of 
greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of 
equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to 
eradicate poverty.

New material capex investment
For the purposes of the 2020 evaluation discussed on pages 28-32, ‘new 
material capex investment’ means a decision taken by the resource 
commitment meeting (RCM) in 2020 to incur inorganic or organic 
investments greater than $250 million that relate to a new project or 
asset, extending an existing project or asset, or acquiring or increasing a 
share in a project, asset or entity.
There were three investments that met the above criteria in 2020. 
Material capex evaluation: Paris-consistency quantitative tests.
For the purposes of evaluating material capex investments for 
consistency with the Paris goals, two quantitative tests were applied, see 
page 32.
1.Operational carbon intensity (CI)
The annual average operational GHG emissions (TeCO 2e/unit), divided 
by the relevant unit of output: 
•per thousand barrels of oil equivalent in Upstream
•per utilized equivalent distillation capacity in refining
•per thousand tonnes in petrochemicals.
Net zero aims and ambition glossary
Net zero
References to global net zero in the phrase, 'to help the world get to net 
zero', means achieving '...a balance between anthropogenic emissions by 
sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases...on the basis of 
equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to 
eradicate poverty', as set out in Article 4(1) of the Paris Agreement. 
References to net zero for bp in the context of our ambition and Aims 1 
and 2 as set out on page 49  (such as 'be a net zero company by 2050 or 
sooner'), means achieving a balance between (a) the relevant Scope 1 and 
2 emissions (for our Aim 1), or Scope 3 emissions (for our Aim 2), and (b) 
the aggregate of applicable deductions from qualifying activities such as","bp aims to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, as stated on page 49. This means that bp's Scope 1 and 2 emissions (for Aim 1) or Scope 3 emissions (for Aim 2) will be balanced with applicable deductions from qualifying activities, aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement and contributing to sustainable development and poverty eradication efforts.",BP PLC_2020," According to the text, bp aims to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner.

Unhelpful Answer: I don't know.

Explanation: The text provides a clear timeframe for bp's aim of becoming a net zero company, stating that the company aims to achieve this goal by 2050 or sooner. Therefore, the answer to the question is 2050 or sooner."

Appointment and time 
commitment
The chairman, senior independent director  
and other NEDs each have letters of appointment 
and do not serve, nor are they employed, in any 
executive capacity. There is no fixed term limit  
on a director’s service; however, in line with good 
governance practice, bp proposes all directors  
for annual re-election by shareholders.Unlike the chairman’s letter of appointment, the 
NEDs’ letters of appointment do not set a fixed 
time commitment. NEDs are expected to allocate 
appropriate time to effectively discharge their 
duties. The time required of NEDs fluctuates 
depending on the demands of bp business and 
other events. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well  
as the oversight by the board of the energy 
transition and associated workload, required  
the NEDs to spend considerably more time 
fulfilling their responsibilities towards bp during 
2020, than in previous years. This included  
NEDs dedicating additional time through regular 
calls with the leadership team to remain informed 
and help guide the executive through 
unprecedented times. 
The NEDs’ external time commitments are 
regularly reviewed, ensuring that, even in the 
exceptional circumstances of a global pandemic, 
the NEDs are able to allocate appropriate time  
to bp. The review process is managed by the 
company secretary, considering NEDs’ outside 
appointments and commitments, including 
relevant factors such as complexity of company 
and industry, in particular highly regulated 
sectors, and issues impacting these other 
companies. The board has concluded that, 
notwithstanding the NEDs’ other appointments, 
they are each able to dedicate sufficient time  
to fulfil their bp duties. 
Executive directors are normally permitted to  
take up one board appointment at an external 
company, subject to the agreement of the 
chairman and after consultation with the 
company secretary. Bernard Looney and Murray 
Auchincloss each hold one non-executive 
directorship, shown on page 74. Prior to retiring

25,What is the stamp duty reserve tax rate for purchases of ordinary shares made outside of the CREST system?,"when the condition is fulfilled). The stamp duty reserve tax will apply to 
agreements to transfer ordinary shares even if the agreement is made

outside the CREST system are subject either to stamp duty at a rate of 
£5 per £1,000  (or part, unless the stamp duty is less than £5, when no 
stamp duty is charged), or stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5% . Stamp duty 
and stamp duty reserve tax are generally the liability of the purchaser.
A subsequent transfer of ordinary shares to the Depositary’s nominee will 
give rise to further stamp duty at the rate of £1.50  per £100  (or part) or 
stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 1.5%  of the value of the ordinary

Specifically, the shift towards cleaner and more efficient vehicles will lead to a decrease in demand for fossil fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, as these vehicles emit fewer emissions and are more efficient. Additionally, the implementation of emission standards for heavy-duty engines and the Cleaner Trucks Initiative will also reduce demand for certain types of fuels. Overall, China's adoption of more stringent emission standards is likely to lead to a shift towards cleaner and more efficient transportation fuels."

45,What are the potential consequences of ethical misconduct or non-compliance with laws and regulations for our business?,"Compliance and control risks
Ethical misconduct and non-compliance – ethical misconduct or 
breaches of applicable laws by our businesses or our employees could  
be damaging to our reputation, and could result in litigation, regulatory  
action and penalties.
Incidents of ethical misconduct or non-compliance with applicable laws  
and regulations, including anti-bribery and corruption and anti-fraud laws, 
trade restrictions or other sanctions, could damage our reputation, and 
result in litigation, regulatory action, penalties and potentially affect our 
licence to operate.
Regulation  – changes in the law and regulation could increase costs, 
constrain our operations and affect our business plans and financial 
performance.
Our businesses and operations are subject to the laws and regulations 
applicable in each country, state or other regional or local area in which  
they occur. These laws and regulations result in an often complex, uncertain 
and changing legal and regulatory environment for our global businesses 
and operations. Changes in laws or regulations, including how they are 
interpreted and enforced, can and does impact all aspects of our business.
Royalties and taxes, particularly those applied to our hydrocarbon activities, 
tend to be high compared with those imposed on similar commercial 
activities. In certain jurisdictions there is also a degree of uncertainty  
relating to tax law interpretation and changes. Governments may change 
their fiscal and regulatory frameworks in response to public pressure on 
finances, resulting in increased amounts payable to them or their agencies.
Changes in law or regulation could increase the compliance and litigation 
risk and costs, reduce our profitability, reduce demand for or constrain  
our ability to sell certain products, limit our access to new opportunities, 
require us to divest or write down certain assets or curtail or cease certain 
operations, or affect the adequacy of our provisions for pensions, tax, 
decommissioning, environmental and legal liabilities. Changes in laws  
or regulations could result in the nationalization, expropriation, cancellation, 
non-renewal or renegotiation of our interests, assets and related rights. 
Potential changes to pension or financial market regulation could also impact 
funding requirements of the group. Following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill,  
we may be subjected to a higher level of fines or penalties imposed in 
relation to any alleged breaches of laws or regulations, which could result  
in increased costs. See Regulation of the group’s business on page 321.Treasury and trading activities  – ineffective oversight of treasury and 
trading activities could lead to business disruption, financial loss, regulatory 
intervention or damage to our reputation.

Saudi Aramco  Annual Report 2020  |  AramcoDear Shareholders,
In 2020, no industry or company was 
immune to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic — including ours.
Aramco, for its part, demonstrated 
considerable financial and widespread operational agility during the most volatile year the world has seen in generations. With the majority of our 
employees working in field locations, we 
proactively put in place comprehensive protective measures to safeguard their safety and well-being, while maintaining our operational integrity and reliability. 
With COVID-19 making daily work and 
life more complex, we benefited from having previously adopted advanced technology and building a robust IT infrastructure — all of which allowed 
us to adjust quickly and enabled our 
employees who could work remotely, 
to do so. 
As part of the battle against COVID-19, we provided support for Saudi Arabia’s healthcare sector, including donating ventilators and other medical equipment and supplies. Our affiliates in Asia, Europe, and North America also engaged in similar initiatives.
Maintaining financial resilience 
Despite the economic fallout of the pandemic, we declared a dividend 
of SAR 281 billion ($75 billion) to our 
shareholders for the year.","According to Aramco, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors are a rising priority for investors today.",Saudi Aramco_2020," According to Aramco, environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are rising priority for investors today."
5,What factors were considered when selecting the components for full scope audits in Korea?,"Korea performed full scope audits of the components at tho se locations. We also requested certain other 
component teams to perform appropriate audit procedures . The selection of t hese components was based 
on qualitative and quantitative considerations, including whether the component accounted for a 
significant proportion of individual consolidated financial statement line items. 
 The Group engagement team’s involvement in the audit work performed by component teams considered 
the relative significance and complexity of the individual component. This included allocating overall Group 
materiality to the different components, sending formal instructions, obtaining regular upda tes on progress 
and results of procedures as well as review of deliverables and the relevant underlying work ing papers.

that lead to the imposition of  import trade 
measures, including anti-dumping and 
countervailing duties, safeguard measures, import licensing and customs requirements, and new or increased tariffs, quotas or embargos. The possibility and effect of any such measures will depend on the laws governing the foreign country to which the applicable products are being 
exported and applicable international 
trade agreements. Foreign countries may take such measures for political or other reasons, including reasons unrelated 
to Aramco’s actions or operations. Since 
the majority of Aramco’s products are exported, any such measures may have 
a material adverse effect on Aramco’s 
business, financial position and results

In addition, the Kingdom is a party to international trade agreements, such as World Trade Organization agreements that include commitments by the Kingdom with respect to the composition of its laws, regulations and practices 
that impact international trade. The 
Kingdom may become a party to 
other  such agreements in the future. 
Compliance by the Kingdom with any such commitments may directly or indirectly impact Aramco and could 
cause  it to alter its operations in a manner 
that is costly or otherwise has a  material 
adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations. If the Kingdom fails to comply with these commitments, Aramco’s business operations could be exposed to scrutiny and Aramco or its affiliates’ exports 
could  be subject to potential remedial 
measures, such as duties, which could have a material adverse effect on Aramco’s business, financial position 
and results of operations.Violations of applicable 
sanctions  and trade restrictions,

corruption laws, could adversely

These include:

1. Loss of revenue: If the Concession is revoked, Aramco may lose its rights to operate in the Kingdom and generate revenue from its downstream operations.
2. Disruption of business operations: The revocation of the Concession could disrupt Aramco's business operations, including its ability to produce and sell hydrocarbons, which could impact its financial position and results of operations.
3. Increased costs: Aramco may incur unanticipated costs or assume unexpected liabilities and losses in connection with any business or asset it acquires, including in relation to the retention of key employees, legal contingencies, and risks related to the acquired business.
4. Difficulty in integrating acquired businesses: Aramco may face challenges in effectively integrating the purchased businesses or assets, which could impact its financial position and results of operations.
5. Adverse changes in economic and trade sanctions: The revocation of the Concession could lead to adverse changes in economic and trade sanctions, which could impact Aramco's ability to operate in the Kingdom and generate revenue.
6. Loss of value of assets: If the Concession is revoked, the value of Aramco's assets may decrease, which could impact its financial position and results of operations.
7. Difficulty in maintaining and integrating procedures, controls, and quality standards: Aramco may face challenges in maintaining and integrating procedures, controls, and quality standards in connection with any business or asset it acquires, which could impact its financial position and results of operations.

Overall, the revocation of the Concession by the Government could have a material adverse effect on Aramco's business, financial position, and results of operations."

countervailing duties, safeguard measures, import licensing and customs requirements, and new or increased tariffs, quotas or embargos. The possibility and effect of any such measures will depend on the laws governing the foreign country to which the applicable products are being 
exported and applicable international 
trade agreements. Foreign countries may take such measures for political or other reasons, including reasons unrelated 
to Aramco’s actions or operations. Since 
the majority of Aramco’s products are exported, any such measures may have 
a material adverse effect on Aramco’s 
business, financial position and results

Compliance by the Kingdom with any such commitments may directly or indirectly impact Aramco and could 
cause  it to alter its operations in a manner 
that is costly or otherwise has a  material 
adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations. If the Kingdom fails to comply with these commitments, Aramco’s business operations could be exposed to scrutiny and Aramco or its affiliates’ exports

The impact of these measures would depend on the laws governing the foreign countries to which the products are being exported and applicable international trade agreements.",Saudi Aramco_2020," According to the text, in 2020, customers in Asia, including Aramco's affiliated refineries located in Asia, purchased 77% of its crude exports and 55% of its total crude production. This means that a substantial portion of Aramco's crude oil and refined products are exported to customers in Asia. Additionally, the text states that foreign countries may take import trade measures, such as anti-dumping and countervailing duties, safeguard measures, import licensing and customs requirements, and new or increased tariffs, quotas or embargos, which could have a material adverse effect on Aramco's business, financial position, and results of operations. Therefore, potential import trade measures could significantly impact Aramco's business by reducing its exports and revenue."

These measures could have a material adverse effect on Aramco's business, as they may lead to increased costs, reduced market access, and disrupted trade relationships with foreign countries.",Saudi Aramco_2020," Sure! Here are some examples of potential import trade measures that could affect Aramco's exports and have a material adverse effect on its business:

1. Anti-dumping and countervailing duties: These measures are designed to protect domestic industries from what is perceived to be unfair competition from foreign producers. If Aramco is found to be selling its products at below market value or receiving unfair government subsidies, it could be subject to duties that increase the cost of its exports and reduce its competitiveness.
2. Safeguard measures: These measures are implemented to protect domestic industries from sudden increases in imports that are deemed to be a threat to national security or domestic industries. If Aramco's exports are deemed to be a threat to national security or domestic industries, it could be subject to safeguard measures that limit its exports or increase the cost of its exports.
3. Import licensing and customs requirements: Governments may impose licensing requirements or customs requirements that make it more difficult or expensive for Aramco to export its products. For example, a government may require Aramco to obtain a license to export a particular product or impose additional customs duties on its exports.
4. New or increased tariffs, quotas, or embargos: Governments may impose new or increased tariffs, quotas, or embargos on Aramco's exports. These measures could increase the cost of Aramco's exports or reduce the quantity of its exports, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.
5. Investigations or other trade actions: If Aramco is subject to investigations or other trade actions, it could face potential penalties or remedial measures, such as duties, that could have a material adverse effect on its business.
6. Export restrictions: Governments may impose restrictions on the export of certain products, such as petrochemicals, which could affect Aramco's ability to export these products and have a material adverse effect on its business.
7. Trade agreements: If the Kingdom enters into new trade agreements that are less favorable to Aramco, it could have a material adverse effect on its business. For example, if the Kingdom enters into an agreement that reduces or eliminates tariffs on Aramco's exports, but also imposes new requirements or restrictions on its exports, it could have a material adverse effect on its business.
8. Environmental claims: If Aramco is subject to environmental claims or lawsuits, it could have a material adverse effect on its business. For example, if it is found to be responsible for environmental damage, it could face significant fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on its business.

These are just a few examples of potential import trade measures that could affect Aramco's exports and have a material adverse effect on its business. The specific measures that could be taken will depend on the laws and regulations of the relevant countries and international trade agreements."

2. Reputation damage: If Aramco is found to have violated sanctions or engaged in unethical business practices, it could damage the company's reputation and lead to a loss of public trust and confidence. This could have long-term consequences for the company's business and financial performance.
3. Business disruptions: Violations of sanctions or anti-bribery/anti-corruption laws could result in business disruptions, including the loss of licenses, permits, or other necessary approvals.

changing environment, there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability around the extent to which the COVID-19 
pandemic will impact our future results, which could be material. 
Chevron entered this crisis well positioned with a strong balance sheet, flexible capital program and low cash flow breakeven 
price. To protect its long-term health and value, the company took swift action, adjusting the items it can control. The 
company lowered its capital expenditures 35 percent and lowered its operating expense, excluding non-recurring severance 
costs, by $1.4 billion compared to 2019. The company completed an enterprise-wide transformation that is expected to 
capture additional cost efficiencies. Additionally, the company suspended its stock repurchase program in March 2020. 
Taken together, these actions are consistent with our financial priorities: to protect the dividend, to prioritize capital spend 
that drives long-term value, and to maintain a strong balance sheet. The company expects to continue to have sufficient 
liquidity and access to both commercial paper and debt capital markets due to its strong balance sheet and investment grade 
credit ratings. Additionally, the company has access to nearly $10 billion in committed credit facilities. 
The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due 
to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower 
tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of 
expected results in future periods. Note 15 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years.

Dividend: Chevron has a long history of paying a consistent and competitive dividend to its shareholders. In 2020, the company paid $5.16 per share in cash dividends, which represents a dividend payout ratio of 60.6% of net income.

Capital Spend: Chevron's capital expenditures in 2020 were $5.13 billion, which is lower than the previous year's expenditures of $8.19 billion. The company's capital expenditures are focused on maintaining and expanding its existing operations, as well as investing in new projects that will drive long-term growth.

Balance Sheet: Chevron's total assets at the end of 2020 were $239.8 billion, with total liabilities of $107.1 billion and total equity of $132.7 billion. The company's debt ratio was 25.2%, which is considered reasonable given the company's size and business mix. Chevron also had $17.8 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of 2020, which provides a significant buffer against potential future capital expenditures or unforeseen events.

2020 2019 2018",Total financing interest and debt costs in 2018 amounted to $921 million.,Chevron_2020," Based on the given information, the total financing interest and debt costs in 2018 can be calculated as follows:

Total long-term debt at December 31, 2018 was $23,691, and the weighted-average interest rate for long-term debt was 1.69%. Therefore, the total financing interest expense for 2018 can be calculated as follows:

Financing interest expense = Total long-term debt x Weighted-average interest rate
= $23,691 x 1.69%
= $387

Additionally, the total debt costs for 2018 can be calculated as follows:

Debt costs = Total long-term debt x Average interest rate
= $23,691 x 1.69%
= $387

Therefore, the total financing interest and debt costs for 2018 were $387.

Note: This answer assumes that the interest rate remains constant throughout the year, which may not be the case in reality. Also, this answer does not take into account any other debt-related costs, such as issuance costs or fees."

24,What is the significance of TOTAL joining the Global Deal initiative in December 2017?,"At the European level, as part of the transformation of TOTAL S.A into a 
Europea
n company (SE), an agreement was reached on April 15, 2020, 
to create the SE Works Council (known as the Total European Works Council) to replace the former European Works Council, while maintaining continuity in its operations and missions.
The Total European Works Council allows the sharing of information and 
exchang
es on the Group’s strategy and social, economic and financial 
situation, as well as on sustainable development, environmental and societal responsibility, and safety matters. It examines any significant proposed organizational change impacting at least two companies in two European countries and expresses its opinion on this in addition to the procedures initiated before the national representative bodies. Innovative measures that allowed improved dialogue with members of the European Works Council in the past (field safety visits and learning expeditions  
to discuss the Group’s strategy directly on site) have been re-included in the agreement that established the new Total European Works Council.111 Universal Registration Document 2020  TOTAL Chapter 3  / Risks and control

rights at work, diversity, the dialogue with employees and their representatives and the recognition of health and safety at work. TOTAL continues to apply the commitments of this global agreement, pending the outcome of discussions with IndustriALL Global Union to reach a new agreement, the process has been slowed down with the health crises and the lockdown measures in 2020.

25,What is TOTAL's approach to limiting the environmental footprint of its sites?,"at a site op
erated by a Group entity or nearby is one of the most closely 
monitored risks in view of the potential consequences. New facility construction projects comply with international technical standards from the design stage in order to limit exposure. For production sites operated by a Group entity and subject to this risk, the One MAESTRO reference framework sets out the prevention process in several stages. First, hazardous products such as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMR) chemicals are listed and their risks identified. Second, potential exposure to levels that may present a risk to the health of personnel, contractors or local residents at the site or nearby are identified and assessed, and prevention or attenuation measures are implemented in order to control the risk. Lastly, the approach is checked (atmospheric checks, specific medical monitoring, audits etc.) in order to verify its effectiveness and implement improvement measures if necessary. This is also set out formally in a risk assessment file, which is revised regularly by the Subsidiary.
Limiting the environmental footprint of the Group’s sites
TOTAL implements a policy of avoiding, reducing, managing and monitoring the environmental footprint of its operations. As part of  this policy, emissions are identified and quantified by environment  (water, air and soil) so that appropriate measures can be taken to better control them.
Water, air
The Group’s operations generate discharges such as smokes from combustion plants, emissions into the air from the various conversion processes and discharges of wastewater. In addition to complying with applicable legislation, TOTAL has drawn up rules and guidelines that the Group’s Subsidiaries can use to limit the quantities discharged. TOTAL has set itself targets for reducing sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions and is 
committed to limiting its hydrocarbon discharges into water. After analysis, the exposed sites can introduce various reduction systems that include organizational measures (such as using predictive models to control peaks in sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions based on weather forecast 
data and the improvement of combustion process management, etc.) and technical measures (wastewater treatment plants, using low NO
X 
burners and electrostatic scrubbers, etc.). To date, all refineries wholly owned by the Group have this type of system.
For new facilities developed by the Group, the internal rules require 
impact a
ssessments to be carried out and, if necessary, actions must  
be taken to limit the impact of these emissions.
Soil
The risks of soil pollution related to TOTAL ’s operations come mainly   
from accidental spills and waste storage. TOTAL has drawn up a guide that the Subsidiaries can use to prevent and contain this pollution.  
The recommended approach is based on four pillars:– preventing leaks, by implementing, as far as possible, industry best practice","TOTAL implements a policy of avoiding, reducing, managing, and monitoring the environmental footprint of its operations.",TotalEnergies_2020," TOTAL has a policy of avoiding, reducing, managing, and monitoring the environmental footprint of its operations.

TOTAL also creates guidelines for its subsidiaries to follow in order to limit the quantities discharged into water and sets goals for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions and hydrocarbon discharges. Additionally, the company has a policy to evaluate and manage the risks related to soil and groundwater pollution and has created a vector for the management of health or environmental impacts identified based on the use of the site.

Changes in the Group’s headcount
The number of employees fell by 2.1% (2,300 employees) between 2019 
to 2020. This decrease is mainly due to the adequate management of recruitments. In 2020, 9,354 employees were hired on a permanent contract within the consolidated scope, a decrease of 36% compared to 2019. Indeed, in view of the global economic crisis in 2020, TOTAL chose to capitalize on its existing strengths in order to weather the storm. To maintain cost discipline — a pillar of its efforts to respond to the crisis — the Group largely narrowed its hiring; industries that are driving the Group’s transformation, such as new energies and digital technology, keeping more to secure TOTAL ’s future. In particular, TOTAL hires experienced candidates for positions requiring key skills, offering them long-term career prospects within the Group.

In 2020, the consolidated Group companies hired 8,657 employees on 
fixed-t
erm contracts, compared to 12,768 in 2019. This decrease is 
mainly identified at Argedis (-65%), which represented 53% of recruitments on fixed-term contracts in 2019 and whose seasonal business (service stations) was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
(1) Employees present as defined in point 5.11.4 of this chapter.","The decrease in the number of employees in 2020 was mainly influenced by the adequate management of recruitments due to the global economic crisis. To maintain cost discipline and respond to the crisis, the company narrowed its hiring and focused on industries driving its transformation, such as new energies and digital technology. Additionally, the company experienced changes in the consolidated scope with the exit of some subsidiaries and the entry of new subsidiaries, affecting the overall headcount.",TotalEnergies_2020," Based on the information provided in the passage, the main factors that influenced the decrease in the number of employees in 2020 were:

1. Adequate management of recruitments: The passage states that the Group chose to capitalize on its existing strengths in order to weather the storm caused by the global economic crisis in 2020, which led to a decrease in the number of employees hired.
2. Cost discipline: The passage highlights that the Group maintained cost discipline in 2020, which contributed to the decrease in the number of employees.
3. Focus on hiring experienced candidates: The passage notes that the Group hired experienced candidates for positions requiring key skills, offering them long-term career prospects within the Group, which may have resulted in a decrease in the number of new hires.

Unhelpful Answer:

1. The pandemic caused a decrease in the number of employees in 2020.
2. The Group experienced a sharp decline in business in 2020, leading to a decrease in the number of employees.
3. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the main factors that influenced the decrease in the number of employees in 2020."

5,What is the potential impact of the Tenth Circuit's decision on the EPA's reallocation of volumes exempted in 2020?,"has proposed to reallocate to non-exempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners 
that were granted a small refinery exemption. Also, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a small 
refinery is eligible for an exemption from the RFS only if it is applying for an extension of its original 
exemption. According to the EPA’s data, seven refineries were granted the small refinery exemption in 
2015. The United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in the 10th Circuit case. If the 10th Circuit 
decision is upheld, EPA’s reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 
2020. The reallocation of volumes under the 2020 rule or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions 
granted to us or other refiners could result in a decrease in the RIN bank, an increase in the price of RINs or 
an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend, any of which could increase MPC’s 
RFS cost of compliance. Further, the EPA has failed to promulgate timely the annual renewable fuel 
standards for 2021.
The RFS is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure 
constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline (“E10”). Since 
2016, the volume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the E10 
blendwall, which will require obligated parties to either sell E15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed 
historical levels or retire carryover RINs.
There is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of the RINs sold on the open market. We 
have developed a RIN integrity program to vet the RINs that we purchase, and we incur costs to audit RIN 
generators. Nevertheless, if any of the RINs that we purchase and use for compliance are found to be 
invalid, we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid RINs.
14In addition to the federal Renewable Fuel Standards, certain states have, or are considering, promulgation 
of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards. For example, California began implementing its Low 
Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) in January 2011. In September 2015, the CARB approved the re-adoption 
of the LCFS, which became effective on January 1, 2016, to address procedural deficiencies in the way the 
original regulation was adopted. The LCFS was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 
20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030. We incur costs to comply with 
the California LCFS, and these costs may increase if the cost of LCFS credits increases.
In sum, the RFS has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or 
expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. We may experience a decrease in demand 
for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced","If the Tenth Circuit decision is upheld, the EPA's reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 2020. This could result in a decrease in the RIN bank, an increase in the price of RINs, or an increase in the amount of renewable fuel companies are required to blend, thereby increasing the cost of compliance for refiners like ExxonMobil.",Marathon Petroleum Corporation_2020," The Tenth Circuit's decision could result in the EPA reallocating volumes greater than the actual volumes exempted in 2020, which could lead to an increase in the RIN bank, a decrease in the price of RINs, or an increase in the amount of renewable fuel required to be blended, any of which could increase MPC's RFS cost of compliance.

Unhelpful Answer: I don't know."
6,How could the reallocation of volumes or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions affect the RIN bank and the price of RINs?,"has proposed to reallocate to non-exempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners

RFS cost of compliance. Further, the EPA has failed to promulgate timely the annual renewable fuel 
standards for 2021.
The RFS is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure 
constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline (“E10”). Since 
2016, the volume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the E10 
blendwall, which will require obligated parties to either sell E15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed 
historical levels or retire carryover RINs.
There is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of the RINs sold on the open market. We 
have developed a RIN integrity program to vet the RINs that we purchase, and we incur costs to audit RIN 
generators. Nevertheless, if any of the RINs that we purchase and use for compliance are found to be 
invalid, we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid RINs.
14In addition to the federal Renewable Fuel Standards, certain states have, or are considering, promulgation 
of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards. For example, California began implementing its Low 
Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) in January 2011. In September 2015, the CARB approved the re-adoption 
of the LCFS, which became effective on January 1, 2016, to address procedural deficiencies in the way the 
original regulation was adopted. The LCFS was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 
20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030. We incur costs to comply with 
the California LCFS, and these costs may increase if the cost of LCFS credits increases.
In sum, the RFS has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or 
expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. We may experience a decrease in demand 
for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced","The reallocation of volumes under the 2020 rule or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions could result in a decrease in the RIN bank and an increase in the price of RINs. This is because if obligated parties like ExxonMobil are required to blend more renewable fuel to make up for the exempted volumes or the exemptions are invalidated, there will be higher demand for RINs, driving up the price and potentially depleting the RIN bank reserves.",Marathon Petroleum Corporation_2020," The reallocation of volumes or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions could potentially impact the RIN bank and the price of RINs in several ways:

1. Increased demand: If the reallocation of volumes results in an increase in demand for RINs, it could lead to higher prices. This is because the RIN market is a supply-and-demand market, and if demand increases without a corresponding increase in supply, prices will likely rise.
2. Reduced supply: If past small refinery exemptions are invalidated, it could result in a reduction in the supply of RINs available for purchase. This could lead to higher prices as well, as the reduced supply would put upward pressure on prices.
3. Changes in market dynamics: The reallocation of volumes or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions could also lead to changes in market dynamics, such as shifts in the balance of power between buyers and sellers or changes in the way RINs are traded. These changes could impact the price of RINs and the overall stability of the RIN market.

It's important to note that the impact of these events on the RIN market would depend on various factors, including the scale of the reallocation or invalidation, the duration of the event, and the overall state of the RIN market at the time. Additionally, the RIN market is subject to various other factors that could impact prices, such as changes in global demand for transportation fuels, geopolitical events, and regulatory developments."

bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider 
favorable. These include provisions:
• providing that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board; 
• providing for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms; 
• providing that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies; 
• limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders; 
• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken 
at a meeting of the stockholders; 
• establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board 
of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; 
• establishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of 
incorporation; 
• providing that our directors may only be removed for cause; 
• authorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued, which would allow 
our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby 
protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership 
of persons seeking to obtain control of us; and 
• authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of 
directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.

respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one 
or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our 
common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of 
our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified 
transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to 
holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.

• providing that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies; 
• limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;

15,How does the Group classify their financial assets?,"transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; c) the financial assets have 
been transferred and the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, but 
the Group has not retained control.
On derecognition of other equity instrument investments, the difference between the carrying amounts and the sum of the consideration 
received and any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, is recognised in retained earnings. While 
on derecognition of other financial assets, this difference is recognised in profit or loss.
(b) Financial liabilities
The Group, at initial recognition, classifies financial liabilities as either financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost or 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group ’s financial liabilities are mainly financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, including bills payable, accounts payable, other 
payables, loans and debentures payable, etc. These financial liabilities are initially measured at the amount of their fair value after deducting 
transaction costs and use the effective interest rate method for subsequent measurement.
Where the present obligations of financial liabilities are completely or partially discharged, the Group derecognises these financial liabilities 
or discharged parts of obligations. The differences between the carrying amounts and the consideration received are recognised in profit or 
loss.
(c) Determination of fair value
If there is an active market for financial instruments, the quoted price in the active market is used to measure fair values of the financial 
instruments. If no active market exists for financial instruments, valuation techniques are used to measure fair values. In valuation, the Group adopts valuation techniques that are applicable in the current situation and have sufficient available data and other information to support it, 
and selects input values that are consistent with the asset or liability characteristics considered by market participants in the transaction of 
relevant assets or liabilities, and gives priority to relevant observable input values. Use of unobservable input values where relevant observable input values cannot be obtained or are not practicable.
(d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. At each balance sheet date, the fair value is remeasured. The gain or 
loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting is a method which recognises the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item in the same accounting period, to represent the effect of risk management activities.","The Group classifies their financial assets based on criteria such as whether they are loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets. These classifications determine how the assets are measured and accounted for in the financial statements.",Sinopec_2020," The Group classifies their financial assets into different categories based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of cash flows of the financial assets. They classify financial assets into: (1) financial assets measured at amortised cost, (2) financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, (3) financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Additionally, they classify equity instruments into: (1) financial assets held for trading, (2) equity instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss."

loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting is a method which recognises the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item in the same accounting period, to represent the effect of risk management activities.","When derecognition occurs for other equity instrument investments, any difference between the carrying amounts of the investments and the consideration received, along with any cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income, is recognized in retained earnings. This reflects the change in value of the investments and adjusts the retained earnings accordingly.",Sinopec_2020," Derecognition of other equity instrument investments results in the difference between the carrying amounts and the sum of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, being recognised in the statement of profit and loss."
17,How are financial liabilities initially measured by the Group?,"transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; c) the financial assets have 
been transferred and the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, but 
the Group has not retained control.
On derecognition of other equity instrument investments, the difference between the carrying amounts and the sum of the consideration 
received and any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, is recognised in retained earnings. While 
on derecognition of other financial assets, this difference is recognised in profit or loss.
(b) Financial liabilities
The Group, at initial recognition, classifies financial liabilities as either financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost or 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group ’s financial liabilities are mainly financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, including bills payable, accounts payable, other 
payables, loans and debentures payable, etc. These financial liabilities are initially measured at the amount of their fair value after deducting 
transaction costs and use the effective interest rate method for subsequent measurement.
Where the present obligations of financial liabilities are completely or partially discharged, the Group derecognises these financial liabilities 
or discharged parts of obligations. The differences between the carrying amounts and the consideration received are recognised in profit or 
loss.
(c) Determination of fair value
If there is an active market for financial instruments, the quoted price in the active market is used to measure fair values of the financial 
instruments. If no active market exists for financial instruments, valuation techniques are used to measure fair values. In valuation, the Group adopts valuation techniques that are applicable in the current situation and have sufficient available data and other information to support it, 
and selects input values that are consistent with the asset or liability characteristics considered by market participants in the transaction of 
relevant assets or liabilities, and gives priority to relevant observable input values. Use of unobservable input values where relevant observable input values cannot be obtained or are not practicable.

Subsequently, the liabilities are measured using the effective interest rate method, which takes into account the contractual cash flows and any changes in the carrying amount of the liabilities.",Sinopec_2020," Financial liabilities are initially measured at either amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss, depending on the nature of the liability. For amortised cost financial liabilities, the initial measurement is at the amount of the fair value of the liability after deducting transaction costs. For financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, the initial measurement is at the fair value of the liability."

30,What are proved developed oil and gas reserves?,"Proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered: 
a. Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required 
equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well.
b. Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the 
extraction is by means not involving a well.
Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on 
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
The taxes, fees and royalty in China are domestic tax schemes and are paid in cash to PRC authorities. The proved 
reserves includes quantities that are ultimately produced and sold to pay these taxes, fees and royalty.
Proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were based on reports prepared by DeGolyer and 
MacNaughton, Gaffney, Cline & Associates, McDaniel & Associates, Ryder Scott and GLJ independent engineering

a. Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required 
equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well.
b. Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the 
extraction is by means not involving a well.
Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on 
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
The taxes, fees and royalty in China are domestic tax schemes and are paid in cash to PRC authorities. The proved 
reserves includes quantities that are ultimately produced and sold to pay these taxes, fees and royalty.
