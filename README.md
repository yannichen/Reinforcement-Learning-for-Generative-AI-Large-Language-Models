We want to unlock significant insights into the Oil and Gas Industry through the use of generative AI. Company documentations such as annual reports and sustainability reports can range from 50 to 500 pages, and often contain large amount of numeric and textual information. With the help of Large Language Models (LLMs), the process of understanding how the company performs can be really efficient. 

The capstone project aims to test, fine-tune, and improve the performance of the open-source Large Language Model (LLM) - Llama2. Our methodology involved a comprehensive approach to data preparation, including gathering recent annual, sustainability, and quarterly reports from ten leading companies in the Oil and Gas Industry. The project achieved significant advancements, with the fine-tuning process demonstrating a marked improvement in the model's ability to generate optimized prompts and report analysis. The enhanced prompt optimization model achieved higher ROUGE and BLEU scores of 0.251 to o.317 and 0.035 to 0.049, indicating a more significant overlap with the reference good prompt. Additionally, the fine-tuned report analysis model exhibited improved BLEU and Rouge scores of 0.215 to 0.262 and 0.451 to 0.461, confirming its effectiveness in summarizing annual highlights and extracting key performance indicators. This project's success underscores the potential of LLMs in transforming the analysis of industry-specific documentation, paving the way for more efficient and insightful data-driven decision-making.
